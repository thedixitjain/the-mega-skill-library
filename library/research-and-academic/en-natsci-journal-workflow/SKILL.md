# English natural-science journal workflow (en-natsci-journal-workflow)

## Purpose

This is the routing skill. It does not replace a single-journal profile; it first
classifies the manuscript by **discipline, advance type, evidence shape, and
audience breadth**, then routes into the matching per-journal skill for fit and
re-framing. It is a sibling to `en-journal-workflow`, which covers the
econ / finance / management 100.

## Resources to Load When Needed

- If the target family is unclear, read `../../resources/worked-examples/venue-routing.md`
  before choosing a venue.
- If a manuscript sits between broad and specialist venues, read
  `../../resources/exemplars/selection-patterns.md`.
- Before submission-ready advice, use `../../resources/journal-roster.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md` to open the current official author
  instructions for the chosen journal.

## Ask four things first

1. **Advance type:** a single broadly-significant discovery, a mechanism, a new
   method/tool, a definitive clinical result, a theoretical/mathematical result,
   or an authoritative review/synthesis?
2. **Evidence shape:** molecular/mechanistic experiment, in vivo / animal model,
   human clinical trial or cohort, observational/field data, simulation/theory,
   structure determination, benchmark/algorithm, or proof?
3. **Audience breadth:** all of science (Nature/Science/PNAS), a whole discipline
   (Nature-subject / society flagship), or a specialty community?
4. **Submission goal:** swing for a general-science or flagship venue, or optimize
   topic–venue fit and review odds at a strong specialty journal?

## Sibling-Journal Disambiguation

| Confusable targets | Decision rule |
|---|---|
| Nature/Science/Cell/PNAS vs specialist venues | Use broad venues only when the advance changes a field-wide model or practice; completeness alone is not enough. |
| NEJM/Lancet/JAMA/BMJ vs specialty clinical venues | General medicine needs practice-changing clinical evidence; disease-area nuance often belongs in specialty journals. |
| JACS/Angewandte/Nature Chemistry vs ACS Catalysis/materials venues | Decide whether the central advance is molecular chemistry, catalysis mechanism, or materials/device performance. |
| PRL/Nature Physics/Physical Review family | Route by immediacy and conceptual physics breadth, then by subfield and article format. |
| Mathematics vs physics vs CS | Theorem, physical insight, and algorithmic benchmark are different products; pick the reviewer community that evaluates the main claim. |

## Decision rules

- **Significance before submission.** Nature/Science/Cell/PNAS triage most papers
  before review on "broad significance." If the advance is solid but incremental,
  route to the strong specialty or open-access multidisciplinary venue rather than
  burning a flagship desk-reject.
- **"First to report X" is not a contribution** at flagship venues — name the
  conceptual advance, the mechanism, or the definitive evidence.
- **Descriptive ≠ mechanistic.** A correlation, an omics catalogue, or a structure
  with no functional insight routes below Cell/Nature-subject; add mechanism or
  route to a data-resource venue.
- **Clinical evidence hierarchy.** A practice-changing randomized trial belongs at
  NEJM/Lancet/JAMA; an observational cohort or secondary analysis usually routes to
  a society specialty journal. Trial registration + the right reporting checklist
  (CONSORT/PRISMA/STROBE) are prerequisites, not nice-to-haves.
- **Review vs. primary.** Reviews of Modern Physics, Chemical Reviews, Accounts of
  Chemical Research, CA, and Trends are largely *invited* — do not route an
  unsolicited primary-data paper there.
- **Format gates.** A PRL must fit the Letter length limit; a Nature/Cell paper
  must survive editorial triage; an eLife paper enters the Reviewed-Preprint model.
- Always enter the single-journal skill's official-submission checklist before
  submitting; never rely on a stale template.

## Output format

```text
[Top journal skill] <skill-name>
[Alt 1] <skill-name> (reason)
[Alt 2] <skill-name> (reason)
[Do not submit to] <journal> (one-line mismatch reason)
[Biggest current gap] significance / mechanism / evidence / reporting-checklist / formatting / official requirements
[Next step] invoke <skill-name> for single-venue fit and re-framing
```
