# European Urology (european-urology)

## Journal positioning

European Urology is the flagship journal of the European Association of Urology (EAU), publishing high-impact clinical and surgical research across the breadth of urology — uro-oncology (prostate, bladder, kidney, testis, upper-tract), functional and reconstructive urology, endourology and stone disease, andrology, transplantation, and surgical technique and outcomes. It serves academic urologists and the EAU clinical-guideline community and expects rigorous, practice-relevant work with meaningful clinical or oncologic endpoints and, for surgical studies, robust outcome and complication reporting; small single-center case series, retrospective slices without a comparator, and technique notes without outcome data are a weak fit. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid; it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live European Urology author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names European Urology for a uro-oncology, functional-urology, endourology, or surgical-outcomes study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A urology study must be re-framed around a high-impact clinical or oncologic question with rigorous outcome reporting for an EAU readership.
- The author is choosing between European Urology, a general-medicine or oncology journal, and a lower-tier urology venue.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and desk-reject expectations for clinical and surgical urology research.

## Scope & topic fit

- Uro-oncology: prostate, bladder, renal, upper-tract, and testicular cancer — screening, staging, systemic and surgical therapy, and survival/oncologic outcomes.
- Surgical and robotic/minimally invasive technique with comparative outcome and complication data.
- Functional and reconstructive urology, neuro-urology, incontinence, and benign prostatic obstruction with patient-centered endpoints.
- Endourology and stone disease, including device/technology evaluation with outcomes.
- Diagnostic, biomarker, and imaging (e.g., MRI/PSMA-PET pathways) studies with clinically meaningful endpoints and a reference standard.
- Comparative-effectiveness, registry, and systematic-review/meta-analysis work answering a focused urology question.

## Method & evidence bar

- Clinical and surgical studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-centered or oncologic endpoints; surgical outcomes require standardized complication reporting (e.g., Clavien-Dindo) and adequate follow-up.
- The applicable reporting guideline must be followed and its checklist supplied: CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews, STARD for diagnostic accuracy.
- Interventional trials require prospective registration; the registration number and protocol/statistical-analysis plan are expected.
- Surgical comparative studies need an appropriate comparator and adjustment for confounding, case-mix, and surgeon/center learning-curve effects; single-arm series rarely suffice.
- Diagnostic, biomarker, and imaging-pathway claims require an independent validation cohort and an accepted reference standard (e.g., histopathology).
- Observational and registry analyses must address confounding, selection, and competing risks; causal language must match the design.

## Structure & house style

- EAU/Elsevier format with a structured abstract and, where required, a concise "take-home message" / patient-summary element; re-check current article types and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames a focused urology question and its clinical importance; the discussion states the practice or guideline implication plainly and aligns with current EAU guideline terminology.
- Tables/figures follow journal statistical-reporting standards; a CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagram and standardized complication tables are expected where applicable.
- Supplements carry the protocol, full statistical methods, surgical-technique detail, and additional analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and EAU anchors, then cite the current European Urology page you checked.
- Search the live site for "European Urology guide for authors" and follow the current EAU/Elsevier version.
- Re-check article types, word/reference/figure limits, structured-abstract and take-home-message format, and statistical-reporting requirements.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD), data-sharing statement, protocol/SAP submission, and standardized complication reporting for surgical studies.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study answers a focused, high-impact urology question with a clear clinical/oncologic implication.
- [ ] Endpoints are prespecified and patient-centered/oncologic; surgical studies report standardized complications and adequate follow-up.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Trials are prospectively registered with the number in the manuscript; protocol/SAP provided.
- [ ] Comparative studies include an appropriate comparator with confounding/case-mix/learning-curve adjustment.
- [ ] IRB/consent, ICMJE disclosures, and a data-sharing statement are prepared; EAU guideline terminology is used.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Small single-center case series or single-arm retrospective slices with no comparator and limited generalizability.
- Surgical technique notes without standardized complication reporting or adequate follow-up.
- Diagnostic/biomarker/imaging studies without an independent validation cohort or histopathologic reference standard.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Observational analyses with inadequate confounding/case-mix handling or overstated causal claims.
- Narrow local-interest topic better served by a general or lower-tier urology venue.

## Re-routing decision

- Uro-oncology dominated by a systemic-oncology or medical-oncology endpoint → `jama-oncology` / `annals-of-oncology`.
- Practice-changing, broadly significant trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
- Urologic imaging where the imaging method dominates → `radiology`.
- Surgical-outcomes focus outside urology's core readership → `jama-surgery`.
- Pure basic urologic/oncologic cell or molecular mechanism with no clinical translation → a basic-science venue in the natural-science bundle.
