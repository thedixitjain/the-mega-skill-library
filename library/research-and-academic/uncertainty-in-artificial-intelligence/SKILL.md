# Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)

## Conference positioning

Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is a top computer-science conference venue for probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, causal inference, decision making under uncertainty, and calibrated ML. It rewards a paper where uncertainty modeling is the contribution rather than an afterthought. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names UAI / Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence as the target venue.
- A manuscript in probabilistic reasoning needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, causal inference, decision making under uncertainty, and calibrated ML.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to UAI's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Read reviewers as statistical ML specialists. Emphasize assumptions, uncertainty, inference, identifiability, and mathematical clarity before application spectacle.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, causal inference, decision making under uncertainty, and calibrated ML.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: probabilistic, reasoning, graphical, models, causal, inference, decision, making, under, uncertainty, calibrated, venue-specific, contribution, statistics, auai.
- Official anchor domain: www.auai.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Use this profile only when the manuscript's central contribution is genuinely in AI statistics
  and the author can say why UAI reviewers are the primary audience, not merely a convenient
  deadline.
- Closest roster neighbors to compare before final routing: `international-joint-conference-on-
  artificial-intelligence` (IJCAI), `artificial-intelligence-and-statistics` (AISTATS),
  `conference-on-learning-theory` (COLT), `conference-on-machine-learning-and-systems`
  (MLSys). Break ties by contribution type, evidence shape, reviewer community, and the
  current official CFP from www.auai.org.

## UAI-specific routing detail

- Prefer UAI when the paper's core contribution is uncertainty itself: probabilistic reasoning, graphical-model structure, calibration, causal inference under uncertainty, Bayesian decision making, or robust decisions with imperfect information.
- Use AISTATS when the contribution is broader statistical machine learning or estimation/inference methodology where uncertainty is present but not the central representation or decision object.
- Compare with NeurIPS/ICML for general ML method breadth, COLT for learning-theory guarantees, KR/IJCAI for symbolic reasoning, and applied venues when the uncertainty method is mostly a domain evaluation wrapper.

## Method & evidence bar

- Compare against current strong baselines and explain exactly what changes in the algorithm, objective, data, or inference procedure.
- Report ablations that isolate the claimed mechanism; do not rely on aggregate benchmark wins alone.
- Document data, compute, hyperparameters, model selection, and failure cases so the result can be reviewed as science rather than demo output.
- For UAI, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a paper where uncertainty modeling is the contribution rather than an afterthought.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- Frame the contribution as a reusable idea: method, theory, benchmark, dataset, system, or socio-technical finding.
- Separate main claims from exploratory results; reviewers at top AI venues punish overclaiming and hidden cherry-picking.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://www.auai.org/
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP / PCS / START or society portal, as specified for the current cycle.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at UAI, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle AI statistics papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Leaderboard-only novelty with weak explanation of why the method works.
- Unclear data contamination, missing baselines, or evaluation that cannot be reproduced.
- Claims about safety, fairness, health, or society without matching evidence and limitations.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving UAI reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses UAI's bar, compare against `neural-information-processing-systems` / `international-conference-on-machine-learning` / `international-conference-on-learning-representations` / `aaai-conference-on-artificial-intelligence`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
```
