# R&R Rebuttal (joap-rebuttal)

A JAP **R&R** is demanding and usually multi-round. Reviewers and the **action editor** typically ask
for a **sharper theoretical contribution**, **added methodological rigor** (alternative models, CMV
diagnostics, robustness, measurement evidence), and **fuller transparency**. The response letter must
**convert every reviewer**, **reassure the editor on the dual gate** (theory + rigor), and keep the
masked manuscript anonymized.

## When to trigger

- An R&R arrived and you are planning the revision + response letter
- Reviewers requested added analyses, alternative models, robustness, or open-science changes
- A requested analysis would change the claim or the contribution
- Writing the cover note to the action editor

## Strategy

1. **Read the editor's letter as the rubric.** The action editor adjudicates among reviewers and tells
   you which points are decisive — solve those first and visibly.
2. **Point-by-point, every comment.** Quote each comment, then respond; never skip or silently merge one.
3. **Strengthen the contribution, don't just defend.** Many requests (sharper mechanism, alternative
   models tested, CMV diagnostics, measurement invariance, robustness) make the paper stronger — do them
   and say where. If the theory advance is the weak point, rebuild it (route to
   `joap-theory-and-hypotheses`).
4. **Test rival explanations head-on.** JAP reviewers raise alternative models and method artifacts;
   run and report them rather than hand-waving — concede where a rival fits better, defend with evidence
   where it does not.
5. **Place new material wisely.** Core new evidence belongs in the manuscript; extended robustness,
   invariance, and alternative-model tables usually go to **online supplemental materials**, summarized
   in one sentence in the main text.
6. **Keep masking and transparency in sync.** Maintain anonymization in the revised manuscript and
   repository links, and reflect new analyses in the shared data/code and the data-availability
   statement (see `joap-open-science-and-transparency`).

## Response-letter format

For each reviewer comment:

```
> [Quoted reviewer comment]

Response: [What we did / why we respectfully disagree, with evidence].
Change: [Main text section, supplement section, or table/figure number].
```

Open with a short **summary of the main changes** to the action editor; group by reviewer; end each
entry with the location.

## Worked micro-example (illustrative response entries)

For the servant-leadership package, an R&R asked for an alternative model, a CMV check, and a sharper boundary.

```
> R2: Could reverse causality or a third variable explain the safety→
> performance path? An alternative model should be tested.

Response: We agree. We now test (a) the reversed mediation and (b) a model with
prior team performance (Wave 0) as a control; the hypothesized 2-2-2 model fits
better (ΔCFI > .01) and the indirect effect remains (.11, 95% CI [.04, .20]).
The lab experiment provides the causal warrant for the safety path.
Change: Results (alternative models); robustness grid → Supplement S4.

> R1: Same-source bias may inflate the field correlations.

Response: Predictor and outcome were separated by wave and source (member-rated
leadership/safety; supervisor-rated performance). We add a CFA marker-variable
test; estimates are essentially unchanged.
Change: Method (design separation), Results (marker test), Transparency statement.
```

## R&R triage — where each request lands

| Reviewer ask | Default home | Note |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| Alternative / reverse-causal model | Results (core) + supplement detail | this often decides the paper |
| CMV diagnostic (marker, ULMC) | Method + Results | pair with the procedural remedies already used |
| Measurement invariance / extra validity | supplement | summarize one sentence in main text |
| Robustness / sensitivity grid | supplement | cite from one main-text sentence |
| "Sharpen the contribution" | Introduction + Theory | rebuild the mechanism/boundary, don't just reword |
| "Soften causal language" | throughout | scale verbs to the design; reserve causation for the experiment |

## Recurring R&R pushback and the venue fix

- "Theory is still thin" → do not just expand the literature; articulate the new mechanism/boundary and
  rederive the hypotheses (route to `joap-theory-and-hypotheses`).
- "You didn't rule out the alternative" → run the rival model and report the comparison; this is the
  most common reason a JAP R&R fails.
- "Added analysis quietly weakens the effect" → disclose it, interpret it, adjust the claim;
  concealment is the cardinal sin.
- "Data/code don't reflect the revision" → update the deposit and the data-availability statement.

## Anti-patterns

- Ignoring or merging away a comment without a visible response
- Defending against an alternative model instead of testing it
- Adding analyses that contradict the original claim without acknowledgment
- Rewording the introduction and calling it a strengthened contribution
- Letting shared data/code/transparency statement drift out of sync with the revision
- Reintroducing identifying information into the masked revision

## Output format

```
【Editor's decisive points】addressed first? [list]
【Coverage】every reviewer comment answered? [Y/N]
【Contribution strengthened】mechanism/boundary sharpened? [Y/N]
【Rigor strengthened】alternative models + CMV + robustness added? [Y/N]
【Placement】core in main text, extended in supplement? [Y/N]
【Open-science + masking】data/code/statement updated; anonymization intact? [Y/N]
【Next】resubmit via Editorial Manager
```
