# USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI)

## Conference positioning

USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) is a top computer-science conference venue for operating systems, distributed systems, storage, cloud infrastructure, and practical systems design. It rewards a systems paper whose design is built, measured, and shown to change performance or reliability tradeoffs. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names OSDI / USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation as the target venue.
- A manuscript in operating systems needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: operating systems, distributed systems, storage, cloud infrastructure, and practical systems design.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to OSDI's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Read reviewers as systems researchers. A real artifact, workload, and design tradeoff are stronger than a conceptual sketch.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: operating systems, distributed systems, storage, cloud infrastructure, and practical systems design.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: operating, distributed, storage, cloud, infrastructure, practical, design, venue-specific, contribution, flagship, usenix.
- Official anchor domain: www.usenix.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Use this profile only when the manuscript's central contribution is genuinely in systems
  flagship and the author can say why OSDI reviewers are the primary audience, not merely a
  convenient deadline.
- Closest roster neighbors to compare before final routing: `acm-symposium-on-user-interface-
  software-and-technology` (UIST), `acm-symposium-on-operating-systems-principles` (SOSP),
  `usenix-symposium-on-networked-systems-design-and-implementation` (NSDI), `acm-sigcomm`
  (SIGCOMM). Break ties by contribution type, evidence shape, reviewer community, and the
  current official CFP from www.usenix.org.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **Organizer & scope.** **USENIX** Symposium on **Operating Systems** Design & Implementation — OS, runtime, storage, and systems infrastructure.
- **vs NSDI.** NSDI (also USENIX) is **networked/distributed** systems; route OS/runtime/storage results here and networked-systems results to NSDI.
- **vs SOSP.** SOSP (ACM SIGOPS) is the other top OS flagship; OSDI/SOSP alternate-year cadence and committees are the practical routing axis, not topic.

## OSDI-specific routing detail

- Prefer OSDI when the contribution is an operating-system, runtime, storage, resource-management, cloud-infrastructure, or systems-design result with a built artifact.
- Route networked/distributed infrastructure where the network is the object to NSDI, storage-specific persistence work to FAST, and ACM SIGOPS-cycle peers to SOSP when timing/community fits better.
- OSDI evidence should expose the system abstraction, implementation constraints, workload realism, design tradeoffs, and performance or reliability change against mature baselines.

## Method & evidence bar

- Build the artifact or prototype far enough that the core design can be measured under realistic workloads.
- Use appropriate baselines, sensitivity analyses, and workload characterization; systems reviewers look for hidden bottlenecks.
- Separate engineering effort from research contribution: name the abstraction, mechanism, or tradeoff.
- For OSDI, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a systems paper whose design is built, measured, and shown to change performance or reliability tradeoffs.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- Start from a systems pain point and show why existing abstractions fail.
- Use evaluation sections that answer research questions, not a tour of every benchmark run.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/179
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: the current USENIX/ACM/IEEE author kit, artifact policy, and submission system.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at OSDI, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle systems flagship papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Toy implementation or microbenchmark-only evidence for a systems claim.
- No comparison to mature systems or no explanation of deployment constraints.
- Performance gains with unclear workload representativeness.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving OSDI reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses OSDI's bar, compare against `acm-symposium-on-operating-systems-principles` / `usenix-symposium-on-networked-systems-design-and-implementation` / `acm-sigcomm` / `architectural-support-for-programming-languages-and-operating-systems`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
