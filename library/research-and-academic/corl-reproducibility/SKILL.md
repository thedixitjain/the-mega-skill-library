# CoRL Reproducibility

Robot-learning papers have a split reproducibility problem: the *training* half is
software and can in principle be rerun anywhere, while the *hardware* half is a
physical setup nobody else owns. Strong CoRL papers treat these halves
differently — the software half is made **rerunnable**, the hardware half is made
**auditable** — and say plainly which is which.

## The rerunnable half: simulation and training

The silent reproducibility killers in this field are version-shaped:

- **Simulator versions change physics.** Contact solvers, default damping, and
  collision margins shift between releases of MuJoCo, Isaac, PyBullet, and
  friends; a policy's success rate is a function of the simulator build. Pin the
  exact version and any physics-relevant flags.
- **Environment wrappers drift.** Task-suite repositories (benchmark forks,
  custom reward shims) move under you; record the commit hash of every env repo,
  not just your own.
- **GPU nondeterminism.** cuDNN autotuning and atomics make bit-identical
  training runs unrealistic — so define reproducibility at the *distribution*
  level: same configs + fresh seeds should land inside your reported seed spread.

```yaml
# repro-manifest.yaml — ship at the repo root; one block per results table
table_3:
  code_commit: ""            # your repo @ exact hash
  env_suite:  {repo: "", commit: "", sim: "mujoco==X.Y.Z", physics_flags: []}
  training:   {config: "configs/table3.yaml", seeds: [0,1,2,3,4], gpu: "1xA100-80GB", hours: 14}
  data:       {demos: "dataset-v2 (1,204 episodes)", url_or_status: "", license: ""}
  checkpoints: {released: true, path: "ckpts/table3/", selection_rule: "last epoch, no eval peeking"}
  evaluation: {script: "eval/run.py", episodes_per_task: 50, init_state_list: "eval/states.json"}
expected_tolerance: "per-task success within ±4 pts of Table 3 mean"
```

The `selection_rule` line matters more than it looks: checkpoint selection via
test-set peeking is the field's quiet irreproducibility engine, and stating the
rule is the cheapest credibility purchase available.

## The auditable half: hardware

Nobody will re-run your robot, so the goal is that a skeptical expert could
*verify the experiment happened as described* and *rebuild an equivalent rig*:

| What to document | Why an auditor needs it |
|---|---|
| Robot model, end-effector, firmware/driver versions | Behavior differs across firmware, not just robots |
| Sensor models, mounting poses, calibration procedure | Camera extrinsics silently dominate visuomotor results |
| Control interface: frequency, action space, safety filters | "30 Hz end-effector deltas" vs "torque control" are different papers |
| Deployed compute + inference latency | Policy behavior is latency-dependent |
| Scene inventory: objects (make/size), fixtures, lighting | Enables an equivalent-rig rebuild and honest comparison |
| Raw episode logs and unedited evaluation video | The audit trail for every printed success rate |

Log every evaluation episode at capture time (timestamped video plus a CSV of
outcomes); retrofitting an audit trail after reviews ask for it is impossible.

## Data and checkpoint release

- Demonstration datasets are results: release episode counts, collection method
  (teleop rig, scripted, crowdsourced), operator count, and filtering rules.
- Released checkpoints let others reproduce *evaluation* even when training is
  too expensive to repeat — for large policies this is often the highest-value
  artifact you can ship.
- If data or weights cannot be released (proprietary platform, human-subject
  footage), say so in the paper with the reason, and release what remains:
  configs, eval scripts, sim environments, and metrics logs. A precise
  partial-release statement outperforms a vague "code available upon request."

## During review vs after acceptance

- During review everything must be anonymous (see `corl-submission`): anonymized
  repo mirrors, no lab-identifying video, no cloud buckets with named projects.
- The 2026 camera-ready pipeline has a sharp constraint: **PMLR does not accept
  video as supplementary material**, so post-acceptance videos, code, and data
  live on external hosting (project site, GitHub, archive), linked from the main
  text (corl.org author instructions, read 2026-07-08). Plan the public homes of
  artifacts before the October camera-ready deadline, and prefer DOI-stamped
  archives for anything you cite as permanent.
- No formal reproducibility checklist was verified for the 2026 cycle in this
  pack (待核实) — but reviewer expectations enforce one informally; use the
  manifest above regardless of what the form requires.

## Availability statement patterns

```text
Strong:  "Code, training configs, evaluation scripts, and the 1,204-episode
          teleop dataset: <URL>. Checkpoints for Tables 2-4: <URL>. Hardware
          evaluations are documented in Appendix C (rig spec, logs, uncut video);
          the platform itself cannot be redistributed."
Weak:    "Code will be released upon acceptance."      (unverifiable promise)
Broken:  "Results reproducible with standard settings." (no artifact at all)
```

## Pre-submission audit

```text
[ ] repro-manifest present; one block per headline table
[ ] Simulator/env/driver versions + commits pinned everywhere
[ ] Seed policy stated; checkpoint selection rule stated
[ ] Hardware rig spec complete enough for an equivalent rebuild
[ ] Episode-level logs + uncut eval video archived internally
[ ] Data/checkpoint release plan with named blockers, if any
[ ] Anonymous during review; external hosting plan ready for camera-ready
```

https://www.corl.org/contributions/instruction-for-authors before promising any
artifact channel — PMLR-side constraints and CoRL-side forms both change yearly.
