# Nature Geoscience (nature-geoscience)

## Journal positioning

Nature Geoscience is the Nature-portfolio journal for the solid earth, ocean, atmosphere, and planetary sciences, publishing research that represents a significant conceptual advance in understanding Earth as a coupled, dynamic system. The journal serves a broad geoscience readership — geophysicists, geochemists, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, and planetary scientists — and every paper must have significance beyond its sub-discipline. A paper about mantle dynamics must speak to surface processes researchers; an ocean chemistry paper must connect to climate or biogeochemical cycles. Highly local, purely descriptive, or incrementally improved geochemical datasets without a conceptual advance do not fit. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool. It does not replace the journal's current official submission guidelines. Before submitting, re-check the live author instructions on the Nature Portfolio site.

## When to trigger

- The author names Nature Geoscience as the target venue for a high-significance earth or planetary science manuscript.
- A geoscience manuscript reveals a new Earth-system process, mechanism, or coupling that changes how the community thinks about a problem.
- The author is choosing between Nature Geoscience, Nature Climate Change, and specialty journals (JGR, GRL, Earth and Planetary Science Letters) and needs tier/scope guidance.
- The author needs Nature Geoscience's desk-reject heuristics and credible re-routing options.

## Scope & topic fit

- Solid-earth geophysics and geodynamics: mantle convection, plate tectonics, subduction dynamics, seismic imaging — when a new mechanism or Earth-system coupling is revealed, not just a regional seismic survey.
- Geochemistry and geochronology: isotope systematics, element cycling, planetary differentiation — when results change the understanding of a major Earth-system reservoir or process, not just refine a local dataset.
- Oceanography and marine biogeochemistry: ocean circulation, carbon cycling, nutrient fluxes, deep-sea processes — when a new process or cross-system coupling is identified.
- Atmospheric chemistry and dynamics: trace-gas chemistry, aerosol formation, atmospheric circulation — when a new mechanistic or global-scale understanding is established.
- Climate history and paleoclimatology: deep-time climate change, glacial cycles, abrupt transitions — when the record constrains Earth-system sensitivity or reveals a new process, not just extends a proxy record.
- Planetary science and astrobiology: comparative planetology, habitability, solar-system evolution — when the result has broad significance for understanding planetary systems.

## Method & evidence bar

- Data quality must be explicitly documented: analytical uncertainties, sampling statistics, and instrument calibration/validation at the standard expected for the specific proxy or technique.
- Geochemical or geophysical datasets must be interpreted in an Earth-system framework — a regional dataset must be placed in global context or must constrain a global model.
- Modeling studies must use state-of-the-art Earth-system or geophysical models with clear documentation of boundary conditions and parameter choices; sensitivity tests are expected.
- Proxy interpretations (paleoclimate, paleoceanography) must address potential confounders and alternative interpretations; a single proxy without corroborating evidence is insufficient for a major mechanistic claim.
- Cross-disciplinary integration is rewarded: geochemistry + geophysics, oceanography + atmosphere, or proxy records + Earth-system models are the kinds of combinations that win at Nature Geoscience.
- Data archiving: datasets must be deposited in an appropriate disciplinary repository (e.g., PANGAEA, SESAR, EarthChem) before or at acceptance; re-check current deposition requirements.

## Structure & house style

- Nature Geoscience publishes Articles and Letters (re-check current type options); both are compact relative to specialty-journal norms, with Extended Data and Supplementary Information carrying essential supporting material.
- The introduction must establish the Earth-system significance in language accessible to the full geoscience community, not just the sub-discipline: what process or coupling is poorly understood, and how does this paper resolve it?
- The central advance must be distillable to one sentence that an oceanographer and a seismologist can both appreciate.
- Extended Data figures carry essential supporting data, maps, model diagnostics, and additional proxy records; SI carries full analytical protocols, raw data tables, and model code.
- Nature's reporting summary and data/code availability statement are required; re-check current policies for specific deposition obligations by data type.
- Figures: maps must include scale bars and geographic context; time-series must clearly label axes with units and age conventions; model output must distinguish observations from model results.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the official source anchors for this journal family, then cite the current journal-specific page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Nature Geoscience author instructions" and follow the current Nature Portfolio version.
- Re-check article-type definitions and word/figure/Extended Data limits.
- Re-check Nature's reporting summary requirements (statistics, reproducibility, datasets, analytical methods).
- Confirm data deposition requirements: which repository is appropriate for your data type (PANGAEA, SESAR, EarthChem, IRIS, NCAR, others).
- Re-check competing-interests, funding, author-contribution, and AI-use disclosure requirements.
- Re-check preprint and embargo policies; coordinate with Nature's press office for high-profile submissions.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence stating the Earth-system advance: what process, mechanism, or coupling does this paper establish or revise?
- [ ] The significance is legible to the full geoscience community — not only to sub-discipline specialists.
- [ ] The dataset or model is placed in a global or system-level context; regional significance alone is insufficient.
- [ ] Alternative interpretations are addressed and data quality (uncertainties, calibration) is explicitly documented.
- [ ] Data are deposited in the appropriate disciplinary repository; Extended Data and reporting summary are complete.
- [ ] The paper is not a record-breaking dataset extension without a conceptual advance.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- A regional geochemical or geophysical dataset with no clear Earth-system implication or mechanism — even an excellent dataset.
- Extending an existing proxy record or seismic survey with improved resolution but without a new mechanistic interpretation.
- Modeling study with an underdocumented model, implausible boundary conditions, or no comparison to observational constraints.
- Paleoclimate interpretation based on a single proxy without addressing confounders or providing multi-proxy corroboration.
- A paper written exclusively for sub-discipline specialists with no attempt to establish significance for the broader geoscience community.
- Climate-dominant framing that is better suited to `nature-climate-change` (especially if impacts, policy, or human dimensions are central).

## Re-routing decision

- Climate-focused advance with impacts, adaptation, or policy dimensions → `nature-climate-change`.
- Earth-system advance with sustainability/human dimensions → `nature-sustainability`.
- Solid-earth geophysics at archival depth → JGR-Solid Earth, Geophysical Research Letters, or Earth and Planetary Science Letters.
- Oceanography/atmospheric chemistry at specialty depth → JGR-Oceans, JGR-Atmospheres, or Geophysical Research Letters.
- Biogeochemistry with energy/environmental significance → `energy-and-environmental-science` or Global Biogeochemical Cycles.
