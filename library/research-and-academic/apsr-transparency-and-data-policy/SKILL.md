APSR requires conditionally accepted authors to deposit a reproducibility package in the APSR Dataverse (Harvard Dataverse), which the editorial office verifies before publication. Covers quantitative and qualitative transparency and exemptions. Prepares the package; it does not waive requirements."

# Transparency & Data Policy (apsr-transparency-and-data-policy)

APSR does not just ask for data — it **verifies** that the deposited materials reproduce the
manuscript's tables and figures **before** publication. Build the package as you go so conditional
acceptance does not stall.

## When to trigger

- Building the reproducibility/replication package
- A manuscript reached **conditional acceptance** and the editorial office requested materials
- Data cannot be fully shared (privacy, ethics, legal/provider restrictions) and you need the
  exemption path
- A **Replications and Reappraisals** submission (materials expectations are central)

## What APSR requires (verify current wording on the policy page)

1. **Deposit to the APSR Dataverse.** Authors of **conditionally accepted** manuscripts submit a
   **reproducibility package** to the **APSR Dataverse on Harvard Dataverse** — the journal's
   dedicated repository with permanent identifiers and preservation. Not a personal website or generic
   cloud link.
2. **Editorial verification.** The office reviews the package to confirm it can **reproduce the
   manuscript's tables and figures** and that the research process is documented well enough. Treat
   this as a real check, not a formality.
3. **Quantitative materials.** Data, code, and documentation sufficient to regenerate every reported
   result. Master script + README + pinned versions + seeds.
4. **Qualitative materials.** Share the materials and data used, alongside literature citations, in a
   form that supports the claims (e.g., evidence tables, annotated sources), with access controls
   where needed (QDR is an option for controlled access).

## When data cannot be shared (exemption path)

- **Explain why** the relevant data are not available (ethical/privacy concerns or legal restrictions
  by the data provider).
- Provide **README instructions on exactly how others can obtain the data** (access process,
  application, provider contact).
- Where possible, **provide synthetic data** resembling the unavailable data so the code can be run.

## Package skeleton (what the verifiers should find)

```
apsr-repro/
├── README.md            # provenance, environment, run instructions, exhibit map
├── run_all.{R,do,sh}    # one entry point → every table and figure
├── data/
│   ├── raw/             # as obtained (or access instructions if restricted)
│   └── constructed/     # built by scripts, never by hand
├── code/
│   ├── 01_build.*       # raw → analysis data
│   ├── 02_analysis.*    # estimates
│   └── 03_exhibits.*    # writes output/Table1.tex, output/Figure2.pdf, ...
└── output/              # regenerated exhibits, named to match the manuscript
```

The README's **exhibit map** — "Table 1 ← code/03_exhibits.* lines …; runtime ~N minutes" — is what
lets the editorial office verify quickly instead of bouncing the package back.

## Verification dry run (before conditional acceptance, not after)

1. Clone the package to a **fresh directory or machine** — not your working tree.
2. Run only what the README says. Any manual step you perform but did not write down is a defect.
3. Diff every regenerated exhibit against the manuscript: numbers, rounding, N's, note text.
4. Record total runtime in the README; flag any step needing > a few hours or special hardware.
5. Have a coauthor or colleague repeat steps 1–3 cold. If they ask you a single question, the
   answer belongs in the README.

## Preregistration discipline (APSR-specific)

Preregistration and pre-analysis plans are **encouraged, not required** — but if you reference one:

- Share it **anonymized** (as an appendix or via an anonymized OSF view) so double-anonymous review
  survives; a PAP with your name on it defeats the anonymization you did everywhere else.
- **Mark registered vs. unregistered analyses clearly** in the text — this is the stated
  expectation, and it converts "exploratory" from a weakness into a labeled category.
- Keep a **deviations note**: every departure from the plan, with the reason, in the appendix.

## Build-as-you-go checklist

- [ ] One **master script** regenerates **every** table and figure from raw/constructed data
- [ ] **README** documents data provenance, construction steps, and how to reproduce each exhibit
- [ ] **Seeds** set and reported for every stochastic step
- [ ] Software/package **versions pinned** (`renv.lock` / `requirements.txt` / recorded installs)
- [ ] Exhibit numbers in the manuscript **match** the package output exactly
- [ ] Restricted data: exemption note + access instructions + synthetic data where feasible
- [ ] Preregistration / pre-analysis plan linked (anonymized) where applicable

## Anti-patterns

- Treating the deposit as a post-publication afterthought (it gates publication)
- Depositing code that does not actually reproduce the printed tables/figures
- A personal URL instead of the APSR Dataverse
- Claiming data are restricted without giving an access path or synthetic substitute
- Undocumented, un-seeded, unpinned code that "works on my machine"

## Output format

```
【Repository】APSR Dataverse (Harvard) — package staged? [Y/N]
【Reproduces tables/figures?】master script verified locally? [Y/N]
【Documentation】README + provenance + seeds + pinned versions? [Y/N]
【Restricted data?】exemption note + access path + synthetic data?
【Qualitative transparency】evidence/sources documented? [Y/N/NA]
【Next】apsr-review-process
```
