# AAMAS Topic Selection

Use this before writing. AAMAS is strongest when the *agents* are the research object - when the
result exists because multiple self-interested or cooperating agents interact - not when a
single-agent method is dressed in multiagent vocabulary.

## Fit test

- Prefer AAMAS when the contribution advances game-theoretic reasoning, multiagent learning,
  mechanism design, auctions, negotiation, argumentation, coordination and teamwork, agent-based
  simulation, or social choice, with the interaction as the object.
- Route to NeurIPS or ICML if the core is a single-agent or general ML method and the
  multiagent setting is only a testbed.
- Route to AAAI or IJCAI if the contribution is broad AI - planning, knowledge representation,
  reasoning - without an interaction result at its center.
- Route to EC (Economics and Computation) if the contribution is primarily equilibrium
  computation, market design, or auction theory with the economics framing dominant.
- Route to the JAAMAS journal (or its AAMAS presentation track) when the work needs
  journal-length exposition and a full-length archival treatment.
- Check early whether the interaction result can be made convincing in an 8-page body.

## Fit signal table

| Signal in the project | AAMAS reading |
|---|---|
| A solution concept, mechanism, or coordination result paired with multiagent experiments | Core fit - the house genre |
| Emergent behavior that only appears because agents co-adapt | Core fit |
| Strong single-agent method benchmarked in a multiagent environment | Better served at NeurIPS or ICML |
| Pure market/auction theory with economics as the point | EC or an econ-CS journal |
| Broad AI reasoning with no interaction at its center | AAAI or IJCAI |

## Vignette: where a communication-learning project goes

A project trains agents to communicate and shows higher cooperation in a mixed-motive game.
AAMAS reading: strong fit if the analysis is about the *interaction* - what the emergent protocol
signals, whether it is incentive-compatible, how it changes the equilibrium. Strip the incentive
and coordination analysis and keep only a reward curve, and the same project reads as a general
MARL paper better suited to NeurIPS or ICML; grow it into a full theory of the signaling
equilibrium, and EC or JAAMAS becomes the better home.

## Sharpening moves before committing

- Name the interaction primitive: solution concept, mechanism, protocol, negotiation strategy,
  or coordination guarantee. If none exists, the AAMAS framing does not exist either.
- Apply the frozen-agent test: if the result survives with the other agents replaced by a static
  environment, it is single-agent and belongs elsewhere.
- Confirm the experiments can probe the interaction (deviation tests, held-out opponents), not
  merely accompany it.
- Topic emphasis and track structure drift between cycles; scan the current CFP and track list
  before final routing.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] strong AAMAS / possible AAMAS / better elsewhere
[Best venue] AAMAS / AAAI / IJCAI / NeurIPS / ICML / EC / JAAMAS / other
[Interaction primitive] <solution concept / mechanism / coordination / negotiation / none>
[Contribution sentence] <one sentence>
[Top rejection risk] <single-agent-in-disguise / concept-unnamed / thin-evaluation / scope>
[Next action] <theory, experiment, framing, or venue switch>
```
