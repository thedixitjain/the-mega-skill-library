# ICSE Reproducibility

At ICSE, reproducibility is not an optional badge chase bolted on after
acceptance — it is one of the four scored review criteria. The 2027 call
(read 2026-07-08) scores **Verifiability and Transparency**: whether the paper
gives enough information to understand how the innovation works, how data was
obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, and whether independent verification or
replication is supported. Build for that score at review time; the
post-acceptance badge process (`icse-artifact-evaluation`) then becomes cheap.

## The open-science posture

The research track is governed by the ICSE Open Science policy. Its verified
2027 shape:

- Research results should be accessible to the public; empirical studies
  should be reproducible where possible.
- **Sharing is the default; non-sharing is what requires justification.**
- Authors provide anonymized links to data/repositories, or upload anonymized
  material via HotCRP's supplementary option.
- Authors who cannot share add a short statement of reasons in a **Data
  Availability section placed after the Conclusion**.
- Sharing is not formally mandatory for acceptance — but it is scored terrain.

## Availability statements that read as honest

```latex
% Full sharing
\section*{Data Availability}
Our replication package -- tool source, the 17-project benchmark with
version pins, all scripts, and raw result CSVs -- is archived anonymously
at <anonymized-link>. Post-acceptance it moves to a DOI-issuing archive.

% Partial sharing, justified
\section*{Data Availability}
Scripts, codebooks, and aggregated results are at <anonymized-link>.
Interview recordings and transcripts cannot be shared: our IRB protocol
and consent forms promise participants non-disclosure. We include the
interview guide and the full codebook so the analysis can be audited
and the study re-run in another organization.
```

The failing pattern is the vague middle: "data available upon reasonable
request" — reviewers read it as *no*. Name exactly what is in the package,
exactly what is withheld, and the specific reason (IRB terms, NDA, licensing),
plus what you provide *instead* so partial verification remains possible.

## Reproducibility evidence by study type

| Study type | What the package must pin down |
|---|---|
| Tool + benchmark evaluation | Source, build recipe, exact benchmark versions, run scripts, seeds, timeouts, raw outputs, analysis notebooks |
| Repository mining | Corpus construction queries, repo list with SHAs, mining date, filtering code, intermediate datasets |
| LLM-based technique | Prompts verbatim, model identifiers with versions/dates, decoding parameters, cached raw responses, cost logs |
| Controlled experiment / survey | Instruments, task materials, anonymized responses, analysis scripts, power/sampling notes |
| Qualitative study | Interview guide, codebook with definitions, agreement computation, anonymized excerpts as consent allows |

Two SE-specific provenance rules. **Mining decays:** repositories get
force-pushed, deleted, and relicensed, so archive the extracted dataset, not
just the query. **LLM outputs decay faster:** hosted models change silently,
so cached raw responses are the only durable record — a package that requires
re-querying a hosted API cannot reproduce your numbers, only re-sample them,
and should say so explicitly.

## Determinism ledger for tool experiments

Before the evaluation runs at scale, freeze and record: random seeds and where
they enter; dependency lockfiles and container digest; hardware and OS;
timeout and memory limits; any nondeterminism you could not remove (thread
scheduling, hosted-API sampling) with its measured impact across repeated
runs. Ten minutes of ledger discipline in May prevents the September review
comment "results could not be understood well enough to assess" — a
verifiability score you cannot response your way out of.

## Anonymity vs verifiability at review time

The package must be double-anonymous like the paper. Use an anonymizing host
or a scrubbed archive; strip git history (`git archive`, never a `.git`
clone), notebook author fields, container labels, hard-coded home paths, and
lab-server hostnames in configs. Do not let anonymization destroy usefulness:
replace identifying strings with placeholders, but keep the code runnable —
an artifact that fails to run because anonymization broke imports scores as
absent.

## Five-question self-audit

Run this on the eve of submission, answering as a hostile stranger:

1. Can each headline table be regenerated by a named command in the package?
2. Is every dataset either included, fetchable by pinned script, or its
   absence justified in the availability statement?
3. Would the numbers survive the disappearance of every external service the
   study touched (GitHub, a hosted model API, a CI provider)?
4. Does the paper's method section alone — without the package — let a peer
   re-implement the technique's core?
5. Is anything in the package identifying, and is anything in it broken *by*
   de-identification?

Any "no" maps to a specific review sentence you can predict — and preempt.

## Reverify each cycle

The policy's mechanics (HotCRP supplementary option, statement placement,
badge linkage) are cycle-set; the sharing-by-default principle has held across
recent editions but its enforcement wording moves. Whether reviewers are
*required* to examine supplementary material was not verifiable for 2027 —
待核实 — so keep every decision-critical fact in the 10 pages and treat the
package as evidence, not overflow.

## Output format

```text
[Verifiability score forecast] can a stranger re-derive each headline number? per-claim y/n
[Availability statement] full / partial-justified / missing; vague-middle phrases found
[Package audit] study-type row above -> items present / absent
[Provenance] pins recorded (SHAs, model versions, dates); decay risks named
[Anonymity] scrub pass results; runnability after scrubbing confirmed
```
