# Critical Care Medicine (critical-care-medicine)

## Journal positioning

Critical Care Medicine is the flagship journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine
(SCCM), publishing clinical and translational research centered on the **care of the
critically ill across the whole ICU** — sepsis, ARDS, resuscitation, shock, multiorgan
failure and organ support, and the systems and processes of critical-care delivery. Its
defining expectation is a **clinically important advance in intensive-care management or
critical-illness mechanism that informs how clinicians care for ICU patients**, not a
narrow single-center series with no outcome relevance or a basic experiment without
critical-illness anchoring. Unlike the broader pulmonary/critical-care flagship,
Critical Care Medicine is ICU-discipline-focused and spans the whole critically ill
patient, not just the lung. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid;
it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current
instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live Critical Care Medicine
author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names Critical Care Medicine for an ICU, sepsis, resuscitation, or organ-support
  study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A critical-care study must be re-framed around an intensive-care management question or a
  critical-illness mechanism with outcome relevance.
- The author is choosing between Critical Care Medicine, AJRCCM (broader respiratory +
  critical care), and The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and ICU-trial/quality
  expectations.

## Scope & topic fit

- Sepsis and septic shock: resuscitation, antimicrobial timing, hemodynamics, and outcome
  studies.
- ARDS and acute respiratory failure: ventilation strategy, oxygenation, and rescue therapies
  in the ICU context.
- Resuscitation and shock: fluids, vasopressors, cardiac arrest, and post-resuscitation care.
- Organ support and multiorgan failure: renal replacement, ECMO, nutrition, and sedation/
  delirium management.
- ICU systems, quality, staffing, and process-of-care and outcomes research, including
  long-term/post-ICU outcomes.
- Translational critical-illness science (immunology, endothelial/coagulation biology) anchored
  to critically ill patients or relevant models.

## Method & evidence bar

- Studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-centered ICU endpoints
  (mortality, organ-failure-free or ventilator-free days, functional outcome); surrogate
  physiologic endpoints need justification.
- The applicable reporting guideline and checklist are expected: CONSORT for trials, STROBE
  for observational work, PRISMA for systematic reviews, ARRIVE for animal studies.
- Trials require prospective registration and the registration number; protocol/SAP are
  expected, and pragmatic/cluster designs need appropriate analysis.
- Observational ICU analyses must address confounding by indication, immortal-time and
  selection bias, and missing data; causal language must match the design.
- Translational claims need controls and replication and must anchor to critically ill
  patients or validated models.
- Effect estimates need confidence intervals and absolute as well as relative measures.

## Structure & house style

- SCCM format with a structured abstract and a key-points/clinical-relevance statement;
  re-check current article types (Clinical Investigation, etc.) and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames the ICU clinical gap; the discussion states the management
  implication and bounds generalizability to ICU practice.
- A CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagram is expected for the relevant design; animal work
  reports ARRIVE-aligned detail.
- Tables/figures follow the journal's statistical-reporting standards; a supplement carries
  the protocol, full statistical methods, and additional analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and SCCM anchors,
  then cite the current Critical Care Medicine page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Critical Care Medicine SCCM instructions for authors" and follow
  the current version.
- Re-check article types, abstract and key-points format, and word/figure/reference limits.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/ARRIVE),
  data/code-availability, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent (including waived/deferred consent for emergency research),
  animal-care/IACUC approval, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding,
  and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study delivers a clinically important ICU-management advance or a critical-illness mechanism with outcome relevance.
- [ ] ICU endpoints are prespecified and powered; trials are registered with the number in the manuscript.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/ARRIVE) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Observational analyses address confounding by indication, immortal-time/selection bias, and missing data.
- [ ] Translational claims are anchored to critically ill patients or validated models with controls.
- [ ] IRB/consent (incl. deferred consent), IACUC (if animal), ICMJE disclosures, and a data-availability statement are prepared.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Single-center descriptive ICU series with no outcome relevance and limited generalizability.
- Observational analyses with confounding by indication or immortal-time bias and overstated causal claims.
- Surrogate physiologic endpoints presented as clinically definitive without patient outcomes.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Lung-biology-dominant or purely respiratory-mechanism work better placed in a broader respiratory venue.

## Re-routing decision

- Pulmonary biology / respiratory-mechanism dominant over ICU management → `american-journal-of-respiratory-and-critical-care-medicine`.
- High-impact respiratory/critical-care trial with broad reach → `the-lancet-respiratory-medicine`.
- Perioperative critical care, sedation, or anesthesia-led ICU work → `anesthesiology`.
- ICU AKI / renal-replacement centered on nephrology → `journal-of-the-american-society-of-nephrology` / `kidney-international`.
- Broad practice-changing critical-care trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
