# Hepatology (hepatology)

## Journal positioning

Hepatology is the flagship journal of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), publishing original research spanning liver biology and disease — from molecular and cellular hepatobiliary science through translational and clinical studies in viral, metabolic (MASLD/MASH), alcohol-related, autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, liver cancer, and transplantation. It serves a North-American-anchored but international hepatology and hepatobiliary-science readership and the AASLD practice-guideline community, with a notable strength in mechanistic and basic/translational liver biology alongside practice-relevant clinical research. Confirmatory or descriptive work without a clear mechanistic or clinical advance, and studies with weak biological grounding, are a poor fit. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid; it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live Hepatology author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names Hepatology for a basic, translational, or clinical liver study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A liver study must be re-framed around a mechanistic advance in liver biology or an AASLD-relevant clinical finding for a North-American/international readership.
- The author is choosing between Hepatology (AASLD), Journal of Hepatology (EASL), and a general GI or general-medicine venue.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and desk-reject expectations for hepatology.

## Scope & topic fit

- Cellular and molecular hepatobiliary biology: hepatocyte/cholangiocyte and stellate-cell biology, liver immunology, fibrogenesis, regeneration, and metabolism.
- Metabolic and steatotic liver disease (MASLD/MASH) and alcohol-related liver disease — mechanisms, models, biomarkers, and trials.
- Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV, HDV) virology, host response, and clinical/therapeutic studies.
- Cirrhosis, portal hypertension, decompensation, and acute/acute-on-chronic liver failure — pathophysiology and outcomes.
- Liver cancer (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma) tumor biology, microenvironment, and clinically anchored studies; autoimmune/cholestatic disease (AIH, PBC, PSC).
- Liver transplantation biology and outcomes, including ischemia-reperfusion, rejection, and immunosuppression science.

## Method & evidence bar

- Basic/translational studies need rigorous controls, adequate biological replication, and validation across complementary models with disease relevance; single-cell-line claims are insufficient.
- Clinical studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, clinically meaningful endpoints; surrogate/biomarker endpoints (fibrosis stage, viral markers) require validation and justification.
- The applicable reporting guideline must be followed and its checklist supplied: CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews, STARD for diagnostic accuracy; ARRIVE-aligned animal-study reporting where relevant.
- Interventional trials require prospective registration with the registration number and protocol/statistical-analysis plan.
- Mechanistic claims must be supported by direct, manipulative evidence (gain/loss of function), not correlation alone; human-sample validation strengthens fit.
- Observational and registry analyses must address confounding, selection, and competing risks; causal language must match the design.

## Structure & house style

- AASLD/Wiley format with a structured abstract; re-check current article types (Original Article, etc.), graphical-abstract requirements, and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames a focused biological or clinical question and its significance; the discussion states the mechanistic interpretation and, where relevant, the clinical/guideline implication, using current AASLD nomenclature (MASLD/MASH).
- Figures must include the controls, replication, and quantification supporting each mechanistic claim; CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagrams are expected where applicable.
- Supplements carry full methods, antibody/reagent and model details, the protocol, and extended analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and AASLD anchors, then cite the current Hepatology page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Hepatology AASLD author guidelines" and follow the current AASLD/Wiley version.
- Re-check article types, word/figure limits, structured- and graphical-abstract format, and statistical/reagent-reporting requirements.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD), data/code-sharing statement, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent, animal-use approval and ARRIVE-aligned reporting, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study delivers a clear mechanistic advance in liver biology or an AASLD-relevant clinical finding.
- [ ] Mechanistic claims rest on manipulative evidence with adequate controls and replication, ideally with human-sample validation.
- [ ] Clinical endpoints are prespecified and meaningful; surrogate/biomarker endpoints are validated.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD) and, for animal work, ARRIVE-aligned reporting are completed.
- [ ] Trials are prospectively registered with the number in the manuscript; protocol/SAP provided.
- [ ] IRB/animal ethics and consent, ICMJE disclosures, and a data-sharing statement are prepared; nomenclature follows current AASLD terms.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Mechanistic claims from a single model or cell line with correlative-only data and no functional manipulation.
- Descriptive clinical series with no mechanistic or practice advance and limited generalizability.
- Biomarker/non-invasive-test studies without an independent validation cohort or reference standard.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, animal-ethics approval, or the required reporting checklist; outdated steatotic-liver-disease nomenclature.
- Observational analyses with inadequate confounding/competing-risk handling or overstated causal claims.
- Topic with narrow local interest better served by a subspecialty GI, transplant, or general-medicine venue.

## Re-routing decision

- European/EASL audience emphasis or EASL-guideline framing → `journal-of-hepatology`.
- Luminal-GI, endoscopy, or broad practice-relevant GI/hepatology with a US clinical readership → `american-journal-of-gastroenterology`.
- Liver-cancer study dominated by a systemic-oncology endpoint → `jama-oncology` / `annals-of-oncology`.
- Practice-changing, broadly significant trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
- Pure cell/molecular hepatobiliary mechanism with no disease translation → a basic-science venue in the natural-science bundle.
