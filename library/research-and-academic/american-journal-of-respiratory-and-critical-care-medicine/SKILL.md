# American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (american-journal-of-respiratory-and-critical-care-medicine)

## Journal positioning

The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (AJRCCM, the American
Thoracic Society "Blue Journal") is the ATS flagship, publishing high-impact research
across the full respiratory–critical-care–sleep spectrum and across the full evidence
spectrum: definitive clinical trials and cohorts, translational mechanism, and basic
pulmonary, vascular, and immunologic science. Its defining expectation is a
**conceptually important advance in lung biology, respiratory/critical-illness
disease mechanism, or pulmonary/sleep clinical care** — not an incremental
single-center series or a descriptive cohort with no mechanistic or practice-changing
yield. Because it spans bench to bedside, AJRCCM tolerates basic and translational work
that a purely clinical respiratory journal would not. This skill is a **fit /
venue-selection / re-framing** aid; it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does
not replace the journal's current instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check
the live AJRCCM author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names AJRCCM or the "Blue Journal" for a respiratory, pulmonary-vascular,
  critical-care, or sleep-medicine study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A clinical, translational, or basic-science lung study must be re-framed around a
  mechanism or a practice-changing pulmonary/critical-illness question.
- The author is choosing between AJRCCM, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (clinical/trial
  high-impact), and Critical Care Medicine (ICU-focused).
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and basic/animal-study
  expectations spanning bench-to-bedside work.

## Scope & topic fit

- Adult and pediatric pulmonary disease: asthma, COPD, ILD/pulmonary fibrosis, cystic
  fibrosis, infection, and pulmonary vascular disease (PAH).
- Critical-care and acute respiratory illness: ARDS, mechanical ventilation, acute lung
  injury — with mechanistic or outcome rigor.
- Sleep and circadian medicine: sleep-disordered breathing and its physiologic or
  outcome consequences.
- Translational and basic lung science: lung development, immunology, epithelial and
  endothelial biology, and animal/cell models that illuminate human disease.
- Clinical trials, large cohorts, and biomarker studies with respiratory or
  critical-illness endpoints.
- Pulmonary physiology, imaging, and -omics studies that establish a disease mechanism
  or a new biological insight.

## Method & evidence bar

- Clinical studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-centered
  endpoints; trials require prospective registration and the registration number.
- The applicable reporting guideline and checklist are expected: CONSORT for trials,
  STROBE for observational work, PRISMA for systematic reviews, ARRIVE for animal studies.
- Translational/basic work must show rigorous controls, biological replication, blinded
  and randomized animal experiments where applicable, and reagent/model validation.
- Mechanistic claims need direct causal evidence (perturbation, not correlation alone);
  human relevance should be anchored to patient samples or validated models.
- Effect estimates need confidence intervals and absolute as well as relative measures;
  causal language must match the design and the species/model studied.
- Sample-size, replication, and statistical-analysis plans must be explicit for both
  clinical and laboratory studies.

## Structure & house style

- ATS format with a structured abstract and an "At a Glance Commentary" / scientific
  knowledge statement; re-check current article types (Original Article, Concise
  Clinical Study, etc.) and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames the biological or clinical gap; the discussion states the
  mechanistic insight or practice implication plainly and bounds overreach.
- A CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagram is expected for the relevant clinical design;
  animal studies report ARRIVE-aligned design detail.
- Figures must show representative data with statistics, N, and replication; an online
  supplement carries full methods, the protocol/SAP, and additional experiments.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and ATS anchors,
  then cite the current AJRCCM page you checked.
- Search the live site for "AJRCCM American Thoracic Society instructions for authors"
  and follow the current version.
- Re-check article types, abstract and At-a-Glance format, and word/figure/reference limits.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/ARRIVE),
  data/code-availability, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent, animal-care/IACUC approval for laboratory work, ICMJE
  authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study delivers a clear mechanistic insight or practice-changing respiratory/critical-illness finding.
- [ ] Clinical endpoints are prespecified and powered; trials are registered with the number in the manuscript.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/ARRIVE) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Basic/translational work shows controls, biological replication, and model validation.
- [ ] Mechanistic claims rest on perturbation evidence and are anchored to human relevance.
- [ ] IRB/consent, IACUC (if animal), ICMJE disclosures, and a data-availability statement are prepared.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Single-center descriptive series or registry slice with no mechanism and no practice change.
- Association-only biomarker or -omics studies with no validation cohort or functional follow-up.
- Animal/cell work without disease relevance, replication, or ARRIVE-aligned rigor.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Narrow ICU-management question better served by an intensive-care journal, or a purely clinical trial with limited mechanistic depth.

## Re-routing decision

- High-impact respiratory clinical trial without a mechanistic core → `the-lancet-respiratory-medicine`.
- ICU-management / organ-support focus over pulmonary biology → `critical-care-medicine`.
- Perioperative respiratory or sedation/ventilation in surgery → `anesthesiology` / `jama-surgery`.
- Broad practice-changing significance beyond pulmonology → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
- Pure basic immunology/cell biology with no lung-disease anchor → a basic-science venue in the natural-science bundle.
