# R&R Rebuttal for JOM (jom-rebuttal)

## When to trigger

- You received a major-revision (R&R) decision from JOM
- You must turn Department Editor, Associate Editor, and reviewer comments into a revision plan
- You need a point-by-point response letter that survives a second round
- Method-check or identification concerns must be resolved before resubmission

## Triage the letter first

JOM's decision is filtered through a Department Editor and Associate Editor on top of reviewers. Before writing:

1. **Extract the DE/AE's decisive priorities** — these set what must change for the paper to survive. They outrank individual reviewer asks when those conflict.
2. **Separate method-check issues** (sampling, measurement validity, identification/endogeneity, common-method remedies, reproducibility). Given JOM's institutionalized Empirical Research Methods gate, these usually must be **fully resolved**, not argued away.
3. **Flag contribution concerns** — "operations not central enough" or "theory contribution thin" require reframing via `jom-contribution-framing`, not just more tables.
4. **Note presentational items** — exhibits, APA style, length, clarity.

## Build the response letter

- One numbered entry per comment, quoting it, then your response, then the **exact change and location** (section/page/table).
- Lead each response with what you *did*; reserve disagreement for cases where you can defend the original with evidence, and do so respectfully.
- For new analyses (alternative identification, added robustness, a new operational measure, additional respondents/sites), report them transparently — including results that did not change the conclusion.
- Keep operations at the heart in every revision; do not let added analyses dilute the operations argument.

## Multi-round expectations

Expect more than one round; first-round acceptance is essentially unheard of. Maintain a clean changelog and a reproducible analysis pipeline so each round's edits are traceable. Re-run the similarity check (single-source <1%, overall <15%) on the revised manuscript, and update disclosures (e.g., any new prior-data use).

## Anti-patterns

- Answering reviewers while ignoring the DE/AE's decisive framing.
- Arguing away a method-check/identification concern instead of fixing it.
- Cosmetic edits where the editor asked for a substantive operations or theory change.
- Reporting only the robustness checks that worked.

## Triage matrix for a JOM decision letter

Sort every comment before drafting. The categories below reflect how JOM's Department-routed, methods-gated process weights concerns; resolution norms are interpretive — confirm against your letter's instructions.

| Comment type | Source weight | Typical resolution norm |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Operations-as-heart / contribution | DE/AE decisive | Reframe via `jom-contribution-framing`; change it |
| Method-check (sampling, measurement, identification) | Methods gate | Fix fully; arguing away rarely survives |
| Theory mechanism | DE/AE + reviewers | Strengthen the a priori operations logic |
| Robustness / alternative specification | Reviewer | Add and report transparently, nulls included |
| Presentation (exhibits, APA, length) | Reviewer | Implement; low-cost goodwill |

## Response-letter desk-reject and irritation triggers

- Answering reviewer points while ignoring the DE/AE's decisive framing — the fastest route to a reject.
- Reporting only the robustness checks that confirmed it.
- Cosmetic edits where the editor asked for a substantive operations or theory change.

## Worked vignette: resolving an identification objection across rounds

An R&R on a supplier-disruption archival study carries one decisive AE concern — reverse causality between disruption exposure and resilience investment — plus six reviewer asks (illustrative). Triage: the AE concern is the survival issue, so the revision leads with a new identification strategy (an instrument from upstream geographic shocks, first-stage F reported, exclusion argued in operations terms), then folds the reviewer points around it. The letter opens each entry with what was done and the exact table/page, reports the instrumented estimate even though it attenuates, and states the operational conclusion holds in direction. Because the decisive method-check concern is fixed rather than rebutted, the paper can clear the second round.

## Editor pushback on the letter, and the remedy

- *"You addressed reviewers but not the editor's main concern."* Restructure the letter so the DE/AE's decisive priorities are resolved first and visibly.
- *"Operations is still not central enough."* Re-anchor the revised argument on the operations mechanism; do not let robustness tables dilute it.

## Calibrating round expectations (hedged)

First-round acceptance is essentially unheard of at JOM and multiple developmental rounds are the norm; budget for at least one more round and keep a clean changelog and reproducible pipeline so edits stay traceable. This reflects JOM's review culture, not a guaranteed outcome — read your letter for the editor's stated trajectory.

## Output format

```
【DE/AE decisive priorities】...
【Method-check issues to resolve】sampling/measures/identification/reproducibility ...
【Contribution reframes needed】...
【New analyses planned】...
【Response-letter structure】numbered, change+location per comment
【Similarity re-check + disclosure updates】...
【Round】expect multiple; changelog maintained
```
