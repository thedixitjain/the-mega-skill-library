# Submission Preflight (apsr-submission)

The last check before pressing submit on **Editorial Manager**. APSR is **double-anonymous**, so the
single most common avoidable failure is an under-anonymized manuscript. Verify volatile specifics on
the official page before relying on them.

## When to trigger

- "Submitting tomorrow" — last pass before upload
- Unsure which files/metadata Editorial Manager expects
- Confirming the chosen track's caps are met and the manuscript is properly anonymized

## Process facts (verify volatile items on the official page)

- **Owner / publisher:** American Political Science Association (APSA) / Cambridge University Press.
- **Portal:** **Editorial Manager** (`editorialmanager.com/apsr`).
- **Review model:** **double-anonymous** — anonymize the manuscript; provide a separate title page.
- **Tracks:** Regular Article (< 11,000 words), Research Note (< 7,000 words — see 待核实 on the exact
  cap), Replications and Reappraisals, Syntheses, Registered Reports.
- **Abstract:** **≤ 150 words.**
- **Word count:** put it on the **front page**; counts **include tables, figures, and printed
  footnotes**, **exclude** the reference list and online appendices.
- **Style:** **APSA Style Manual for Political Science** (author-date).
- **ORCID:** required for the **corresponding author** (submissions after 1 Jan 2019).
- **Fee:** no submission fee and no APSA-membership requirement (verified 2026-06-22). Hybrid Cambridge journal; post-acceptance Gold OA APC is optional — Cambridge 2026 standard **£2,610 / US $3,655** plus tax (re-verify the current rate before submission).

## Anonymization deep-audit (the failure that actually happens)

Under double-anonymous review the manuscript file itself must not identify you. Beyond deleting the
byline, sweep these known leak points:

- **Self-citations.** Keep the citations (omitting them distorts the literature) but voice them in
  the third person: *"as we demonstrated (Author 2021)"* → *"as Author (2021) demonstrates."* Avoid
  a wall of "Anonymized (2021)" placeholders — a cluster of redactions identifies you almost as
  reliably as a name.
- **Acknowledgments, grant numbers, IRB protocol numbers** — move to the separate title page; an
  IRB number is traceable to an institution.
- **File metadata** — author fields, tracked-changes and comment names, PDF creator strings. Strip
  in the source *and* re-check the compiled PDF.
- **Links** — replication or preregistration URLs on a named account; use anonymized views until
  acceptance.
- **Prose tells** — "our earlier fieldwork," a dataset only one team possesses, thanks to a named
  RA. Do one full read asking only: *could a reviewer in my subfield guess?*

## Computing the word count

Count the body **plus tables, figures, and printed footnotes** (captions and cell text included);
**exclude** the reference list and online appendix; print the number on the **front page**. Leave a
few hundred words of headroom — revisions grow papers, and an R&R should not burst the track's cap.

## Submission-day sequence

1. Freeze the manuscript; run the anonymization sweep above on the frozen file.
2. Compile two files: anonymized manuscript + separate title page.
3. Log in to Editorial Manager under the corresponding author's **ORCID-linked** account; choose
   the track deliberately (caps and reviewer expectations differ by track).
4. Enter metadata — title, ≤150-word abstract, keywords — matching the manuscript exactly.
5. Proof what the system builds for reviewer view **before approving**: metadata stripped, no
   title-page bleed-through, exhibits render.

## Preflight checklist

### Track & length
- [ ] Track chosen and its word cap met (Article < 11,000 / Note < 7,000)
- [ ] Word count on the front page (includes tables/figures/footnotes; excludes refs + appendix)
- [ ] Abstract ≤ 150 words, states question + approach + finding

### Anonymity (double-anonymous)
- [ ] No author names, affiliations, or acknowledgments in the manuscript
- [ ] No obvious self-references ("as we showed in…"); self-citations neutralized
- [ ] Identifying **file metadata stripped** (document properties, comments)
- [ ] Anonymized pre-analysis plan / OSF link if preregistration is referenced
- [ ] Separate (non-anonymous) title page prepared as a distinct file

### Format & metadata
- [ ] APSA Style Manual formatting; consistent author-date citations
- [ ] Corresponding-author **ORCID** ready
- [ ] Figures/tables self-contained, accessible (see `apsr-tables-figures`)

### Compliance & files
- [ ] Ethics / IRB / human-subjects compliance per APSA principles
- [ ] Original work; preprint status checked against Cambridge preprint policy
- [ ] Reproducibility package staged for the APSR Dataverse at conditional acceptance
      (see `apsr-transparency-and-data-policy`)

## Anti-patterns

- Leaving author identifiers in the text, acknowledgments, or file metadata (breaks anonymity)
- Abstract over 150 words; no word count on the front page
- Sending a long paper to the Research Note track
- Choosing Registered Reports after results exist
- Budgeting for a submission fee that is not charged (none as of 2026-06-22; only optional post-acceptance Gold OA APC)

## Output format

```
【Track】Article / Note / Replication / Synthesis / Registered Report (caps met? Y/N)
【Anonymized】text + self-refs + file metadata clean? [Y/N]
【Abstract】word count (≤150)
【Word count on front page】incl. tables/figures/footnotes? [Y/N]
【APSA style + ORCID】[Y/N]
【Repro package】staged for APSR Dataverse? [Y/N]
【Next】await decision → apsr-rebuttal on R&R
```
