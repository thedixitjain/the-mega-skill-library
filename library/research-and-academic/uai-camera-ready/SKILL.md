# UAI Camera Ready

Use this after the acceptance email. In the 2026 cycle, notification was June 1 and
camera-ready files were due July 27, ahead of the August 17–21 conference in Amsterdam —
roughly eight weeks that also contain registration, travel, and poster production. Reopen
the current camera-ready instructions on the UAI site before starting; PMLR mechanics and
page allowances are settled per cycle and were not fully published at pack-verification
time (final-version page allowance: 待核实).

## Where the paper is going

Accepted UAI papers are published as a volume of the Proceedings of Machine Learning
Research. The series is open access with no author-side publication fee; the conference
is funded by registration. Recent anchors, useful for citing prior UAI work correctly
and for knowing what your own entry will look like: UAI 2021 = PMLR v161, 2022 = v180,
2023 = v216, 2024 = v244, 2025 = v286. The 2026 volume number is assigned by PMLR
(待核实 until the volume page exists).

```bibtex
@inproceedings{deshpande24a,
  title     = {Calibrated and Conformal Propensity Scores for Causal Effect Estimation},
  author    = {Deshpande, Shachi and Kuleshov, Volodymyr},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the Fortieth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence},
  series    = {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},
  volume    = {244},
  pages     = {1083--1111},
  year      = {2024},
  publisher = {PMLR}
}
```

Use this shape (verified against the PMLR v244 metadata) as the model for your own
eventual entry and for citing UAI papers in the camera-ready bibliography.

## De-anonymization pass

Reverse every anonymity measure deliberately rather than by memory:

- Restore the author block, affiliations, and correct ordering; cross-check against the
  OpenReview author list, which feeds proceedings metadata.
- Rewrite third-person self-references back to natural phrasing where it helps clarity.
- Reinstate acknowledgements and grant numbers that the submission rules forced out.
- Replace the anonymized supplementary archive with a public, versioned repository link;
  the CFP's strong encouragement of code and data release is easiest to honor now, when
  no anonymity constraint remains.
- Re-run metadata checks in reverse: the PDF should now carry the true title and authors.

## Reconciling with the review record

- Implement every change you committed to during the author-response phase; area chairs
  occasionally check, and co-authors always remember differently.
- Fold in reviewer-requested clarifications that fit without altering claims. Camera-ready
  is for sharpening accepted content, not for smuggling in new results.
- Keep a one-page changelog mapping each commitment to the section where it landed —
  useful internally and if chairs ask.

## Production checklist

| Item | Failure it prevents |
|---|---|
| Current-cycle UAI template, final (non-anonymous) mode | Volume-wide formatting mismatch flagged by proceedings editors |
| Title/abstract identical across PDF, OpenReview, and PMLR forms | Broken indexing and citation splits |
| Every appendix referenced from the main text still resolves | Dangling "see App. D" after camera-ready edits |
| Figures regenerated from final code | Plot-vs-table divergence in the archival version |
| License and copyright forms as required this cycle | Publication held back on paperwork (exact forms: 待核实) |
| Repository tagged with a release matching the paper | "Code link rots by conference week" failure |

## Presentation obligations

For 2026 the conference stated that all accepted papers are presented in poster sessions
and spotlight presentations, physically or remotely, with selected papers receiving
longer slots. Practical consequences:

- Prepare a poster and a short spotlight talk as the default; treat a longer oral as a
  bonus you learn about later.
- The physically-or-remotely wording is UAI 2026's; whether remote presentation remains
  available, and what registration category it requires, must be reconfirmed against the
  current attendance and registration pages (fees and mandatory-registration rules:
  待核实).
- Build the poster from the paper's inference story — the model, the assumption set, the
  guarantee or diagnostic, one decisive experiment — rather than shrinking eight pages
  onto A0.

## Small print that bites in July

- European venue logistics (2026: Amsterdam) put visa timelines on the critical path
  for many authors — start the invitation-letter process the week of notification.
- August conferences collide with European institutional holidays; confirm your
  co-authors' availability for the forms-and-proofread window before assuming it.
- Poster printing on-site versus shipping is a real decision at international venues;
  decide two weeks out, not on arrival.

## Sequence from acceptance to the conference

1. Week 1: changelog from review commitments; assign owners.
2. Weeks 2–3: text edits, restored identities, regenerated figures.
3. Week 4: public repository release, tagged and linked from the paper.
4. Weeks 5–6: PMLR forms and metadata; internal proofread of the merged PDF.
5. Before the deadline: upload, then re-download and cold-read the archived file.
6. Remaining weeks: registration, visa/travel if attending in person, poster print,
   spotlight rehearsal.

## Metadata consistency sweep

PMLR entries are generated from structured metadata, so one inconsistency propagates
to Google Scholar, DBLP, and every future citation. Sweep these pairs:

- [ ] PDF title ↔ OpenReview title ↔ PMLR form title (including math in titles,
      which PMLR renders from LaTeX — check the escaped form).
- [ ] Author name spellings and diacritics ↔ each author's canonical publishing name;
      a dropped accent forks a Scholar profile.
- [ ] Author order ↔ what the group actually agreed; camera-ready is the last cheap
      moment to fix it.
- [ ] Abstract in the form ↔ abstract in the PDF after final edits.
- [ ] Repository URL in the paper ↔ the tagged release, not the moving main branch.
- [ ] BibTeX self-entry drafted for your own website ↔ the volume's eventual format
      (model it on the verified entry above).

## Output format

```text
[Camera-ready state] not started / in edits / forms pending / uploaded
[Deadline distance] <days to current official camera-ready date>
[Commitment coverage] <review promises implemented / total>
[Public artifacts] repo tagged? data linked? license chosen?
[Presentation prep] poster / spotlight / long-talk status
```
