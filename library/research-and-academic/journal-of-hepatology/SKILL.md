# Journal of Hepatology (journal-of-hepatology)

## Journal positioning

Journal of Hepatology is the flagship journal of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), publishing high-impact clinical, translational, and basic science across the breadth of hepatology — viral, metabolic (MASLD/MASH), alcohol-related and autoimmune liver disease, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure, hepatocellular and biliary cancers, and liver transplantation. It serves an international hepatology readership and a European clinical-guideline community, and expects work that advances mechanistic understanding or changes how liver disease is diagnosed, staged, or managed; descriptive single-center series and incremental confirmatory studies without a clear conceptual or practice advance are a weak fit. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid; it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live Journal of Hepatology author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names Journal of Hepatology for a clinical, translational, or basic liver-disease study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A liver study must be re-framed around a mechanistic insight or a guideline-relevant clinical advance for an EASL/European readership.
- The author is choosing between Journal of Hepatology (EASL), Hepatology (AASLD), and a general GI or general-medicine venue.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and desk-reject expectations for hepatology.

## Scope & topic fit

- Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV, HDV) and emerging therapies, cure strategies, and elimination-relevant clinical research.
- Metabolic and steatotic liver disease (MASLD/MASH), alcohol-related liver disease, and their fibrosis/cirrhosis natural history and trials.
- Cirrhosis, portal hypertension, decompensation, and acute-on-chronic liver failure — pathophysiology, biomarkers, and outcome studies.
- Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma — surveillance, staging, systemic and locoregional therapy with hepatology-relevant endpoints.
- Autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease (AIH, PBC, PSC) and liver transplantation: selection, immunosuppression, and graft/patient outcomes.
- Translational and basic hepatobiliary science (immunology, fibrogenesis, regeneration, omics) with clear disease relevance.

## Method & evidence bar

- Clinical studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, clinically meaningful endpoints; surrogate or biomarker endpoints (e.g., fibrosis stage, viral suppression) need validation and justification.
- The applicable reporting guideline must be followed and its checklist supplied: CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews, STARD for diagnostic/biomarker accuracy.
- Interventional trials require prospective registration; the registration number and protocol/statistical-analysis plan are expected.
- Translational and basic work needs rigorous controls, adequate replication, and validation in human samples or disease-relevant models, not a single cell line or model.
- Diagnostic and prognostic biomarker claims (non-invasive fibrosis tests, HCC markers) require an independent validation cohort and comparison against an accepted reference standard.
- Observational and registry analyses must address confounding, selection, and competing risks (e.g., liver-related death vs. transplant); causal language must match the design.

## Structure & house style

- EASL/Elsevier format with a structured abstract and a concise lay/impact summary where required; re-check current article types (Research Article, Short Communication, etc.) and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames a focused hepatology question and its mechanistic or clinical importance; the discussion states the management or guideline implication and aligns terminology with current EASL nomenclature (e.g., MASLD/MASH).
- Figures and tables follow journal statistical-reporting standards; a CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagram is expected where applicable.
- Supplements carry the protocol, full statistical methods, extended characterization, and additional cohorts/analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and EASL anchors, then cite the current Journal of Hepatology page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Journal of Hepatology guide for authors" and follow the current Elsevier/EASL version.
- Re-check article types, word/reference/figure limits, structured-abstract and impact-summary format, and statistical-reporting requirements.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD), data-sharing statement, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check ethics-committee approval and consent, biobank/genetic-data governance, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study answers a focused hepatology question with a clear mechanistic insight or management/guideline implication.
- [ ] Endpoints are prespecified and clinically meaningful; surrogate/biomarker endpoints are validated and justified.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Trials are prospectively registered with the number in the manuscript; protocol/SAP provided.
- [ ] Translational claims are validated in human samples or disease-relevant models with adequate controls and replication.
- [ ] Ethics/consent, ICMJE disclosures, and a data-sharing statement are prepared; nomenclature follows current EASL terms.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Descriptive single-center series or registry slices with no mechanistic or practice advance and limited generalizability.
- Biomarker or non-invasive-test studies without an independent validation cohort or an accepted reference standard.
- Translational claims resting on one model or cell line with no human validation and weak controls.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist; outdated steatotic-liver-disease nomenclature.
- Observational analyses with inadequate confounding/competing-risk handling or overstated causal claims.
- Narrow local-interest topic better served by a subspecialty GI, transplant, or general-medicine venue.

## Re-routing decision

- North-American/AASLD audience emphasis or AASLD-guideline framing → `hepatology`.
- Luminal-GI, endoscopy, or broad practice-relevant GI/hepatology with a US clinical readership → `american-journal-of-gastroenterology`.
- HCC/cholangiocarcinoma study dominated by a systemic-oncology endpoint → `jama-oncology` / `annals-of-oncology`.
- Practice-changing, broadly significant trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
- Pure basic hepatobiliary cell/molecular mechanism with no disease translation → a basic-science venue in the natural-science bundle.
