# ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)

## Conference positioning

ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is a top computer-science conference venue for functional programming, type systems, semantics, compilers, theorem proving, and language design. It rewards a functional-programming paper with technical depth and clear language-community relevance. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names ICFP / ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming as the target venue.
- A manuscript in functional programming needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: functional programming, type systems, semantics, compilers, theorem proving, and language design.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to ICFP's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Treat ICFP as a functional programming venue whose reviewers expect the scope and evidence to match its own community. Do not submit a generic CS paper until the introduction names the exact subcommunity, contribution type, and proof or empirical standard.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: functional programming, type systems, semantics, compilers, theorem proving, and language design.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: functional, programming, type, semantics, compilers, theorem, proving, language, design, venue-specific, contribution, icfpconference.
- Official anchor domain: icfpconference.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Route to ICFP when the paper is about functional programming languages, type systems,
  semantics, compilers, program reasoning, or applications centered on functional-language
  ideas.
- Compare PLDI for implementation/performance and language design, POPL for principles and
  proofs, OOPSLA for object-oriented/software language systems, and CAV for verification.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **What ICFP is.** The **ACM SIGPLAN** International Conference on **Functional Programming** — functional languages, type systems, semantics.
- **vs POPL / PLDI / OOPSLA.** POPL is principles/theory, PLDI is implementation, OOPSLA is objects/systems; ICFP is the functional-programming home.
- **vs CAV / LICS.** CAV is verification, LICS is logic; route language-design/semantics work to ICFP.

## ICFP-specific routing detail

- Prefer ICFP when the contribution is functional programming: languages, type systems, semantics, compilers, program calculi, functional abstractions, or verified FP practice.
- Route model checking, theorem-proving applications, and formal verification tools to CAV; route broader PL design/implementation to PLDI/POPL when FP is not central.
- ICFP evidence should expose language design, semantics, implementation, examples, evaluation, and how the functional-programming abstraction changes practice.

## Method & evidence bar

- Use real programs, benchmarks, proofs, developer studies, or artifacts matched to the contribution type.
- For tools, report usability, scalability, false positives/negatives, and reproducible artifact details.
- For theory, provide precise definitions and complete proofs; for empirical SE, foreground validity threats.
- For ICFP, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a functional-programming paper with technical depth and clear language-community relevance.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- State the software-engineering or language problem in terms of developer, program, proof, or runtime consequence.
- Keep examples small but nontrivial, then scale evidence to realistic code or formal benchmarks.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://icfpconference.org/
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP / PCS / START or society portal, as specified for the current cycle.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at ICFP, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle functional programming papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Toy examples with no evidence on real programs or benchmarks.
- Tool paper without artifact clarity or comparison to current systems.
- Empirical claims without validity analysis or reproducible data pipeline.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving ICFP reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses ICFP's bar, compare against `international-conference-on-software-engineering` / `acm-international-conference-on-the-foundations-of-software-engineering` / `ieee-acm-international-conference-on-automated-software-engineering` / `acm-sigplan-conference-on-programming-language-design-and-implementation`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
```
