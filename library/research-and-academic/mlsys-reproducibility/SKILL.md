# MLSys Reproducibility

Use this while experiments are still running — reproducibility at this venue is a
measurement-design property, not a packaging afterthought. An MLSys claim is typically
"system A beats system B by X% on workload W on hardware H," and every one of those four
variables can silently drift. The venue's culture (badge-based artifact evaluation, the
MLPerf benchmark lineage published in its own proceedings) means reviewers assume
performance numbers will eventually be re-measured by someone else.

## Two kinds of nondeterminism — control them separately

| Source | Examples | Control |
|---|---|---|
| ML randomness | Init seeds, data order, dropout, sampling temperature | Fix and log seeds; report across-seed variation where accuracy matters |
| Systems noise | Clock boosting/thermal state, co-tenant interference, NUMA/PCIe placement, network jitter, filesystem caches | Warmup phases, repeated trials, exclusive nodes, pinned placement, reporting distributions |

Papers routinely fix seeds meticulously while leaving thermal state and placement
uncontrolled — backwards for a performance paper, where systems noise usually dwarfs
seed effects on latency numbers.

## The environment pin — deeper than requirements.txt

A latency claim depends on layers a Python lockfile never sees. Record all of them:

- Hardware: GPU/accelerator model and count, CPU, memory, interconnect (NVLink/PCIe
  generation, NIC), storage class.
- System: driver version, CUDA/ROCm version, container image digest, kernel version.
- Framework: exact framework build, compilation flags, graph/eager mode, precision
  (FP16/BF16/FP8/INT4), and any autotuning caches — a warm autotuner cache can fake a
  speedup that a fresh machine cannot reproduce.
- Serving stack: batch policy, concurrency limits, admission control settings.

## Measurement harness discipline

```python
import time, statistics

def measure(step, warmup=20, trials=200):
    for _ in range(warmup):          # exclude JIT, autotuning, cache-fill effects
        step()
    xs = []
    for _ in range(trials):
        t0 = time.perf_counter()
        step()                       # synchronize accelerator inside step()
        xs.append(time.perf_counter() - t0)
    xs.sort()
    return {
        "p50": xs[len(xs)//2],
        "p99": xs[int(len(xs)*0.99)],
        "mean": statistics.fmean(xs),
        "stdev": statistics.stdev(xs),
        "trials": trials,
    }
```

- Never report a single run for any latency or throughput number; state trial counts and
  either stdev or percentile spread in every table caption.
- Report tails (p95/p99) for anything serving-shaped; means alone hide the behavior
  systems reviewers care about most.
- Synchronize accelerators before timestamps — async launch makes GPUs look infinitely
  fast in naive harnesses.
- Interleave A/B trials (ABABAB, not AAABBB) so thermal drift and co-tenant noise hit
  both systems equally.
- Keep raw measurement logs; tables should be generated from logs by script, so the
  paper, the artifact, and reality cannot diverge.

## Disclosure floor for the paper itself

- Workload identity: exact models, datasets or traces, sequence-length/request-rate
  distributions, and how the workload was chosen (a named benchmark family beats a
  bespoke workload for credibility — reviewers know the MLPerf-style conventions).
- Baseline versions and their tuning budget, stated symmetrically with your system's.
- Total compute consumed and, where the paper argues cost efficiency, the price basis
  ($/GPU-hour source and date) behind any dollar figures.
- Energy numbers, if claimed, with the measurement method (whole-node meter vs.
  software counters) — the two can disagree wildly.
- What was *not* controlled, honestly: shared cluster, single hardware family, one
  precision mode. A scoped claim survives re-measurement; an unscoped one does not.

## Common measurement bugs this venue catches

Each of these has sunk real performance claims; check for them before a reviewer does.

- **Warm-cache flattery**: benchmarking after the dataset, weights, or autotuner cache
  is hot, while the baseline runs cold. Symmetrize or report both regimes.
- **Async mirage**: timing GPU work without device synchronization, measuring launch
  latency instead of execution.
- **Batch-mismatch comparisons**: your system at its best batch size versus the
  baseline at its default — a tuning-parity violation wearing a measurement disguise.
- **Coordinated omission**: measuring latency only for requests the system accepted,
  while it sheds load; report drop/timeout rates next to every latency figure.
- **Averaging across heterogeneous workloads**: a single mean over workloads of wildly
  different scales lets one workload buy the headline; report per-workload numbers.
- **Power-state contamination**: comparing runs taken at different GPU clock or
  thermal states; record clocks and lock them where the platform allows.

## Pre-submission reproducibility drill

1. Fresh-clone the repo on a machine that has never run the project; follow only the
   README. Every undocumented step found here is a future AE failure.
2. Regenerate the two most important tables from raw logs with one command each.
3. Diff regenerated numbers against the PDF; investigate any discrepancy beyond stated
   variance — this drill catches stale-table bugs that reviewers cannot, but artifact
   evaluators will.
4. Record the wall-clock and dollar cost of the full reproduction; put it in the
   appendix so others can budget.

## Cycle-volatility warning

Whether MLSys requires a reproducibility checklist or statement at submission time is a
per-cycle decision that could not be verified for 2026 (待核实) — check the current CFP
and OpenReview form fields rather than assuming either way. Artifact-evaluation badge
mechanics live in `mlsys-artifact-evaluation`.

## Output format

```text

[Disclosure gaps] <workload provenance/baseline tuning/compute/cost/energy>
[Drill result] <fresh-machine reproduction outcome + cost>
[Fixes] <ordered, cheapest-first>
