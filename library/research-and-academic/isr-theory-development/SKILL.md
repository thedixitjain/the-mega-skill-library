# Theory Development (isr-theory-development)

## When to trigger

- Your predictions are descriptive ("IT use relates to performance") with no mechanism
- You have an analytical model but the propositions are unmotivated or the comparative statics are not theorized
- A reviewer says "where is the IS theory?" or "this could be any social science"
- You must connect a behavioral and an economic/design logic (intradisciplinary work)

## Two theorizing modes — match yours to your genre

ISR houses **behavioral/empirical** and **analytical/economic & design-science** research as co-equal genres. The shape of "theory" differs:

- **Behavioral mode.** Build an explicit causal **mechanism** centered on the IT artifact: how a feature of the system, platform, or algorithm changes cognition, affect, behavior, interaction, or organizing — then derive hypotheses *a priori*. State the boundary conditions and the level(s) (individual → group → firm → network → society). Theorize mediation (the process) and moderation (when it strengthens/weakens), not just main effects.
- **Analytical mode.** Specify agents, payoffs, information structure, and the IT-enabled decision (e.g., platform pricing, security investment, contracting, recommendation, data sharing). The **assumptions are the theory**: justify each, derive equilibrium results, and read the **comparative statics** as the propositions. The contribution is the qualitative insight ("when X, the platform optimally does Y"), not the algebra.

## Make it sociotechnical and intradisciplinary

ISR's distinctive identity is **bridging IS silos**. The strongest manuscripts let the social and the technical co-determine the outcome and connect perspectives that usually stay separate — e.g., an economic model whose parameters are disciplined by behavioral evidence, or a behavioral study whose design is informed by a design-science artifact. Single-paradigm theory is publishable but the intradisciplinary, silo-bridging move is what ISR prizes. If you are combining methods, the 2025 multimethod-research framework editorial (ISR 36(2)) expects you to state how each method's theory informs the others.

## Worked micro-rewrite: generic prediction → IT-anchored mechanism

The reviewer complaint "this could be any social science" is fatal at ISR. The fix is to make a feature of the IT artifact the causal pivot, not the setting.

- **Before (context-only):** "H1: Users who receive more feedback exhibit higher engagement." — True of any feedback in any medium; the technology is a backdrop, so an SE reads it as organizational behavior, not IS.
- **After (IT-anchored, behavioral):** "Because the platform's algorithmic feedback is *quantified and socially comparative* (a design property absent in offline feedback), it triggers upward social comparison that raises effort for below-median users but induces disengagement among bottom-decile users — a non-monotonic effect the feature's granularity uniquely produces." — Now the artifact's design does the theoretical work and the prediction changes if the feature changes.
- **After (analytical variant):** model a platform choosing feedback granularity g; users hold comparison-sensitivity θ; derive that the engagement-maximizing g is interior and falls as the θ-distribution's left tail thickens. The comparative static ∂g*/∂(tail mass) < 0 *is* the proposition — the IS insight ("platforms should coarsen feedback when discouraged users are numerous"), not the algebra.

Both variants pass the swap test in the next section: change the feature, and the prediction moves.

## Anchor every construct to the IT artifact

The IT artifact must do theoretical work. For each construct, ask: would the prediction change if the technology were different? If not, the theory is not yet about IS.

## Checklist

- [ ] Genre named (behavioral vs analytical vs design-science) and theory shaped accordingly
- [ ] Behavioral: explicit mechanism + a priori hypotheses + mediation/moderation + level(s)
- [ ] Analytical: agents/payoffs/information stated; assumptions justified; propositions = comparative statics
- [ ] IT artifact does load-bearing theoretical work
- [ ] Sociotechnical co-determination is visible; an intradisciplinary bridge is attempted
- [ ] Boundary conditions and scope stated

## Anti-patterns

- **Decorated correlations**: "H1: A is positively related to B" with no mechanism.
- **Algebra-as-theory**: deriving an equilibrium without articulating the IS insight it yields.
- **Technology as backdrop**: a mechanism that would hold for any tool.
- **Forced multimethod**: stapling a model to an experiment without a shared theoretical logic.
