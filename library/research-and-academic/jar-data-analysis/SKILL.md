# Data Analysis & Robustness (jar-data-analysis)

## When to trigger

- Data are built and it is time to estimate and report
- You are unsure how to cluster standard errors for your panel
- Referees will probe endogeneity, measurement, or the channel
- You must assemble the reproducible **data-and-code package** JAR posts

## Get the standard errors right (a JAR signature check)

Empirical-accounting referees scrutinize inference. Default to **clustering by firm**, and consider **two-way clustering by firm and year** (Petersen) when both cross-sectional and time-series dependence are present. With **few clusters**, use the **wild-cluster bootstrap** rather than asymptotic cluster-robust SEs. Match the clustering to the source of correlated shocks implied by your design, and report the choice explicitly.

## Execute the identification, don't just assert it

- **DiD**: report pre-trends and use heterogeneity-robust estimators for staggered timing (Callaway-Sant'Anna / Sun-Abraham), not naive two-way FE.
- **RD**: report the optimal bandwidth, robust bias-corrected estimates, a manipulation (density) test, and covariate balance at the cutoff.
- **IV/2SLS**: report the first stage and instrument strength (e.g., F-statistic), and defend the exclusion restriction in words.
- **Event studies**: report abnormal returns with a defensible benchmark model and window, and confront confounding events.

## Measure accounting constructs credibly

Use measures with precedent in prior JAR/JAE work (discretionary accruals, earnings persistence/smoothness, disclosure indices, comparability, audit-quality proxies, bid-ask spread / PIN for information asymmetry). Show the proxy behaves sensibly (validation, correlations with established measures) and test sensitivity to alternative proxies — proxy fragility is a common rejection reason.

## The robustness battery referees expect

- Alternative specifications: controls in/out, alternative fixed effects, alternative measures of the key construct.
- Subsamples and falsification/placebo tests (e.g., effect absent where theory says it should be).
- Sensitivity of identification assumptions (alternative instruments, donut RD, bounds).
- Cross-sectional partitions that confirm the **predicted channel** (the conditional predictions from jar-theory-development).
- Sample-construction and winsorization choices documented and varied.

## Reproducibility is a deliverable, not a courtesy

JAR's **data-and-code sharing policy requires and hosts** the materials. Keep top-to-bottom runnable scripts that regenerate every table and figure from raw extracts; document screens, vintages, and access dates; respect the terms of use (academic-research-only, acknowledgement of the JAR publication and code authors, authors retain copyright). On a **Registered Report**, the executed analysis must match the pre-approved Stage 1 protocol.

## Execution bridge (StatsPAI / Stata MCP)

Run the battery, don't just enumerate it. Full map:
[`execution-with-mcp`](../../../shared-resources/empirical-methods/execution-with-mcp.md). JAR is archival/empirical accounting; foreground identification around disclosure and regulation shocks, with modern DiD where adoption is staggered.

- **Many outcomes / specifications:** `romano_wolf` (step-down FWER) or
  `benjamini_hochberg` — report the adjusted threshold.
- **OVB sensitivity:** `oster_delta` / `sensemakr`.
- **Inference:** `wild_cluster_bootstrap` (few clusters), `twoway_cluster` / `conley`;
  multilevel data → cluster at the right level.
- **Re-fit off one handle:** `audit_result(result_id)` lists the missing checks and the
  exact `suggest_function` for each.
- **Exhibits:** `etable` / `did_summary_to_latex` from the handle — no retyped numbers.

Keep the decisive checks in the body and the exhaustive battery in the appendix. See the
executed chain in the [JF execution walkthrough](../../../Journal-of-Finance-Skills/resources/worked-examples/02-execution-walkthrough.md).
## Checklist

- [ ] SE clustering matches the design (firm / firm-and-year; wild bootstrap if few clusters)
- [ ] Identification executed with diagnostics (pre-trends / bandwidth / first-stage / balance)
- [ ] Modern DiD estimators used for staggered treatment timing
- [ ] Key construct validated; results robust to alternative proxies
- [ ] Robustness, falsification/placebo, and channel partitions reported
- [ ] Winsorization/sample screens documented and varied
- [ ] Reproducible data-and-code package assembled per JAR policy

## Anti-patterns

- **White/robust SEs on panel data** ignoring within-firm correlation.
- **Naive two-way-FE DiD** with staggered adoption.
- **One proxy, no validation** for a contested accounting construct.
- **Significance fishing** across windows, bandwidths, or specifications.
- **"Code available on request"** — JAR requires the package to be posted.

## Output format

```
【Estimator & SEs】model; clustering (firm / firm×year / wild bootstrap)
【Identification executed】diagnostics reported (pre-trends/bandwidth/first-stage)
【Construct measurement】proxy + validation + alt-proxy robustness
【Robustness/falsification】[...]
【Channel partitions】conditional predictions confirmed? [...]
【Reproducibility】data/code package status per JAR policy
【Open issues for referees】[...]
【Next step】jar-contribution-framing
```
