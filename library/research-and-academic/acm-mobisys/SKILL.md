# ACM MobiSys (MobiSys)

## Conference positioning

ACM MobiSys (MobiSys) is a top computer-science conference venue for mobile and embedded systems, sensing, wearables, edge computing, and mobile applications. It rewards a mobile-systems paper whose artifact and measurements survive real-device constraints. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names MobiSys / ACM MobiSys as the target venue.
- A manuscript in mobile and embedded systems needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: mobile and embedded systems, sensing, wearables, edge computing, and mobile applications.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to MobiSys's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Treat MobiSys as mobile systems: device constraints, operating systems, sensing, wearables, energy, edge computation, deployment, and application behavior matter. The paper should not be only a wireless-protocol contribution better suited to MobiCom.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: mobile and embedded systems, sensing, wearables, edge computing, and mobile applications.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: mobile, embedded, sensing, wearables, edge, computing, applications, venue-specific, contribution, sigmobile.
- Official anchor domain: www.sigmobile.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Route to MobiSys when the contribution is mobile systems, sensing, ubiquitous computing
  infrastructure, energy, deployment, or mobile platform design.
- Compare MobiCom for mobile networking, UbiComp for ubiquitous interaction, NSDI/SIGCOMM for
  networked systems, and WiSec for security/privacy.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **What MobiSys is.** The **ACM SIGMOBILE** conference on **mobile systems, applications, and services** — the systems/platform side of mobile computing.
- **vs MobiCom.** MobiCom is wireless/networking-forward; bring mobile-systems and on-device/sensing-systems work here.
- **Routing.** Reserve MobiSys for built mobile systems and services; route protocol/wireless results to MobiCom.

## MobiSys-specific routing detail

- Prefer MobiSys when the contribution is a built mobile, embedded, wearable, sensing, edge, or application system whose research value depends on real-device constraints, energy, latency, deployment, or user/context behavior.
- Use MobiCom when the decisive novelty is wireless networking, spectrum/protocol design, mobility measurement, or network-layer performance rather than the mobile system as an artifact.
- Compare with UbiComp for human/context-rich ubiquitous systems, SenSys/IPSN for sensing infrastructure, NSDI/SOSP/OSDI for broader systems abstractions, and CHI/IMWUT when user experience or longitudinal deployment is primary.

## Method & evidence bar

- Build the artifact or prototype far enough that the core design can be measured under realistic workloads.
- Use appropriate baselines, sensitivity analyses, and workload characterization; systems reviewers look for hidden bottlenecks.
- Separate engineering effort from research contribution: name the abstraction, mechanism, or tradeoff.
- For MobiSys, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a mobile-systems paper whose artifact and measurements survive real-device constraints.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- Start from a systems pain point and show why existing abstractions fail.
- Use evaluation sections that answer research questions, not a tour of every benchmark run.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: the current USENIX/ACM/IEEE author kit, artifact policy, and submission system.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at MobiSys, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle mobile systems papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Toy implementation or microbenchmark-only evidence for a systems claim.
- No comparison to mature systems or no explanation of deployment constraints.
- Performance gains with unclear workload representativeness.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving MobiSys reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses MobiSys's bar, compare against `acm-symposium-on-operating-systems-principles` / `usenix-symposium-on-operating-systems-design-and-implementation` / `usenix-symposium-on-networked-systems-design-and-implementation` / `acm-sigcomm`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] ACM MobiSys (MobiSys)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
```
