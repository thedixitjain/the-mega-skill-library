# Scope & Importance Fit (jama-scope-fit)

## When to trigger

- Before committing weeks to formatting a manuscript for JAMA
- The finding feels solid but you suspect it is too narrow / subspecialty
- Choosing between JAMA, a JAMA Network specialty journal, and a field journal
- An editor or mentor asked "is this really a general-medicine paper?"

## The general-medical-importance test

JAMA serves a broad clinician readership across all of medicine. Ask, in order:

1. **Does it change what a practicing clinician thinks or does?** A result that only matters to a single subspecialty lab rarely fits; a result that informs everyday diagnosis, treatment, or prevention does.
2. **Is the question clinically important, not just statistically novel?** Mechanistic novelty alone is off-fit; patient-relevant outcomes (mortality, function, major morbidity, validated patient-reported outcomes) are on-fit.
3. **Is the evidence near the top of the design hierarchy for the question?** RCTs, large well-controlled cohorts, rigorous diagnostic-accuracy studies, and systematic reviews/meta-analyses are the core. Underpowered pilots and uncontrolled case series are off-fit.
4. **Is it timely and generalizable?** Single-center convenience samples that do not generalize weaken fit.

If you cannot answer (1) and (2) affirmatively, JAMA is probably the wrong home — say so plainly.

## Article-type match (verify current types on the journal site)

| Your study                                       | Likely JAMA article type            |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Randomized clinical trial                        | Original Investigation (with CONSORT)|
| Prospective/retrospective cohort, case-control   | Original Investigation (with STROBE) |
| Diagnostic-accuracy study                        | Original Investigation (with STARD)  |
| Systematic review ± meta-analysis                | Review / Original Investigation (PRISMA) |
| Health-policy analysis with clinical bearing     | Special Communication / Viewpoint    |
| Short, focused dataset                            | Research Letter                      |
| Synthesis without systematic methods              | Off-fit as Original Investigation    |

Match the article type to JAMA's current categories and word/format limits — verify on the official Instructions for Authors page (do not assume fixed numbers).

## What the JAMA desk editor screens before review

JAMA — the Journal of the American Medical Association, the AMA / JAMA Network flagship for a broad clinician readership — desk-rejects most submissions before external review. Triage turns on whether the finding plausibly changes clinical practice or policy, not whether it is correct. Common pre-review desk rejects: a single-center pilot pitched as practice-changing; a surrogate endpoint with no patient-relevant outcome; a retrospectively registered trial (registration must precede enrollment); a mechanism/biomarker paper that changes no decision; an underpowered "negative" trial framed as proof of no effect (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).

## Worked example: routing a vignette (illustrative)

Vignette (illustrative): a multicenter randomized clinical trial, N = 4,200 adults with community-acquired sepsis across 30 sites, restrictive vs liberal IV-fluid strategy; pre-specified primary outcome 90-day mortality, 18.1% vs 21.4%, absolute risk difference -3.3 percentage points (95% CI, -5.9 to -0.7).

- Changes practice (everyday cross-specialty decision), patient-relevant outcome (90-day mortality, CI excludes null), top-of-hierarchy and generalizable (powered, 30-site RCT): all yes.

Verdict: strong fit for a JAMA Original Investigation (CONSORT). Contrast: the same team reporting only a 48-hour serum-cytokine surrogate in 60 patients at one ICU flips to off-fit — route to a specialty journal.

## Reviewer / editor pushback and the JAMA fix

- "Clinical bottom line not actionable for practice." Fix: restate importance as a concrete change to diagnosis, treatment, or prevention; if none exists, the venue is wrong.
- "Audience too narrow for JAMA." Fix: evidence broad relevance, or move to the matching JAMA Network specialty title as plan B.

Calibration anchors (hedge where uncertain): the general-medical-importance bar, the evidence hierarchy, and the clinical-decision-impact standard are durable; article-type word/exhibit caps are volatile — confirm against current author guidelines.

## Checklist

- [ ] The clinical question matters to a broad clinician audience, not one niche
- [ ] Primary outcome is patient-relevant, not a surrogate of unclear value
- [ ] Study design is high on the evidence hierarchy for this question
- [ ] Sample/setting support generalizable conclusions
- [ ] A correct JAMA article type exists for this work
- [ ] If narrow, a JAMA Network specialty journal or field journal is considered as plan B
- [ ] Importance can be stated in one sentence a non-specialist clinician understands

## Anti-patterns

- Pitching a single-center, hypothesis-generating pilot as a definitive Original Investigation
- Leading with mechanistic/molecular novelty rather than clinical consequence
- Surrogate-only endpoints presented as practice-changing
- Assuming high statistical significance equals general medical importance
- Ignoring that a better-fit JAMA Network specialty journal exists

## Output format

```
【Importance verdict】strong fit / borderline / off-fit
【One-sentence clinical importance】...
【Primary outcome patient-relevant?】yes / no
【Evidence level for the question】RCT / cohort / diagnostic / review / weaker
【Proposed JAMA article type】...
【Plan B journal if borderline】...
【Next skill】jama-study-design (if fit) / reconsider venue (if off-fit)
```
