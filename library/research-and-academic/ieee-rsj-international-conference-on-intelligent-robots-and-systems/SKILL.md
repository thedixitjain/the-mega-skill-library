# IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)

## Conference positioning

IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) is a top computer-science conference venue for intelligent robots, embodied systems, perception, navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. It rewards a robotics paper with integrated system validation and credible robot experiments. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names IROS / IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems as the target venue.
- A manuscript in intelligent robots needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: intelligent robots, embodied systems, perception, navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to IROS's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Read reviewers as embodied-systems researchers. Hardware, simulation, task distributions, and failure rates matter more than a clean curve alone.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: intelligent robots, embodied systems, perception, navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: intelligent, robots, embodied, perception, navigation, manipulation, human-robot, interaction, venue-specific, contribution, robotics, flagship, ieee-ras.
- Official anchor domain: www.ieee-ras.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Use this profile only when the manuscript's central contribution is genuinely in robotics
  flagship and the author can say why IROS reviewers are the primary audience, not merely a
  convenient deadline.
- Closest roster neighbors to compare before final routing: `ieee-international-conference-on-
  robotics-and-automation` (ICRA), `robotics-science-and-systems` (RSS), `acm-ieee-
  international-conference-on-human-robot-interaction` (HRI). Break ties by contribution type,
  evidence shape, reviewer community, and the current official CFP from www.ieee-ras.org.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **Sponsorship & cadence.** **Co-sponsored by IEEE RAS and the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ)** (hence "IEEE/RSJ"), established 1988; one of the largest robotics conferences, with a broad perception-and-systems program — distinct from **ICRA**, the IEEE-RAS-only flagship.
- **Center of gravity.** "Intelligent Robots and Systems": perception, sensing, and integrated autonomy at scale; larger, more inclusive program than ICRA in a given year.
- **vs RSS.** RSS is single-track and selective on foundational models; send theory-forward work there, deployed-system breadth here.

## IROS-specific routing detail

- Prefer IROS when the contribution is intelligent robots and systems: perception-action integration, autonomy, robot learning, navigation, manipulation, human-aware robotics, or fielded systems.
- Route broad robotics/automation cycle fit to ICRA, experimental robotics methodology to ISER, and human-interaction studies to HRI/RO-MAN.
- IROS evidence should make system integration, embodied constraints, experiments, reliability, and intelligent behavior under realistic conditions visible.

## Method & evidence bar

- Report hardware, simulation, environment, task distribution, reset procedure, and failure cases; embodied evidence must be inspectable.
- Compare against meaningful robot-learning, planning, or control baselines under matched assumptions.
- Separate simulation gains from real-world transfer and quantify reliability, not only best-case success.
- For IROS, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a robotics paper with integrated system validation and credible robot experiments.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- Lead with the robot task and system constraint before the algorithmic component.
- Use video or supplementary material only as allowed by the current anonymous-review policy.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP / PCS / START or society portal, as specified for the current cycle.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at IROS, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle robotics flagship papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Simulation-only evidence for a claim about real robots.
- No clear task distribution, few trials, or missing failure analysis.
- A learning curve without robot-specific insight or system integration.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving IROS reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses IROS's bar, compare against `ieee-international-conference-on-robotics-and-automation` / `robotics-science-and-systems` / `conference-on-robot-learning` / `acm-ieee-international-conference-on-human-robot-interaction`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
