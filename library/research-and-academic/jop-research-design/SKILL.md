# Research Design (jop-research-design)

JOP is **methodologically diverse** and demanding about each tradition. The design must credibly connect
the argument (`jop-theory-building`) to evidence — and, because **acceptance is contingent on
replicability**, it must be one a **JOP replication analyst** can re-run. This skill is mode-aware: pick
the section matching your work and defend it against the strongest alternative.

## When to trigger

- Specifying identification, case selection, or experimental design
- A reviewer questioned causal claims, case choice, external validity, or a confound
- Preparing a pre-analysis plan
- Justifying why your design adjudicates the rival account from `jop-literature-positioning`

## Quantitative / causal inference
- **Identification first.** State the estimand and the assumptions that license a causal reading
  (ignorability, parallel trends, exclusion, continuity). Defend them, don't assert them.
- **Designs**: experiments (incl. survey/conjoint), DID/event study (use modern staggered-adoption
  estimators, not naive TWFE), IV (first-stage strength, exclusion, weak-IV-robust inference), RDD
  (density/manipulation tests, bandwidth robustness), matching/weighting with balance + sensitivity.
- **Inference**: cluster at the level of treatment assignment; randomization inference for experiments;
  multiple-comparison adjustment when testing many implications.
- **Sensitivity**: how strong must an unobserved confounder be to overturn the result?

## Experiments (lab / survey / field)
- Preregister the design and primary analyses; report power/MDE; pre-specify subgroups.
- Address attention/manipulation checks, attrition, and ethics/IRB and consent.
- For survey experiments: sampling frame, treatment realism, and generalization claims.

## Formal-empirical linkage
- Make the **empirical test follow from the model's comparative statics**, not a loose analogy.
- Distinguish predictions unique to your model from those shared with rivals.

## Qualitative / case-based
- **Case selection** justified by design logic (typical, deviant, most/least-likely, paired comparison)
  — not convenience. Say what the case is a case *of*.
- **Process tracing** with explicit tests (hoop, smoking-gun, straw-in-the-wind); state what evidence
  would have **disconfirmed** the argument.
- **Source transparency**: plan how archives, interviews, and fieldnotes will be documented and cited
  (see `jop-replication-and-data-policy`).

## The adjudication test

For the **single strongest rival explanation**, write one sentence: *"If the rival were true rather than
my argument, the data would look like ___; instead they look like ___."* If you cannot, the design does
not yet identify the contribution.

## Design for replicability (JOP-specific)

- Choose estimators and software you can **fully script** — the analyst re-runs your code.
- Fix the analysis plan so results are not a moving target between drafts.
- Keep the design within the **page budget**: defend it crisply in the main text, push diagnostics to
  the Online Appendix.

## Execution bridge (StatsPAI / Stata MCP)

Estimate and audit the design, don't only describe it. Full map:
[`execution-with-mcp`](../../../shared-resources/empirical-methods/execution-with-mcp.md). Journal of Politics spans observational and experimental political science; report the identifying assumption and the magnitude, not just stars.

- `detect_design` → `recommend` → fit with `as_handle=true` → `audit_result`.
- **Observational causal claims:** staggered DiD (`callaway_santanna` / `sun_abraham` +
  `bacon_decomposition` + `honest_did_from_result`); IV (`effective_f_test` +
  `anderson_rubin_ci`); RDD (`rdrobust` + `mccrary_test`).
- **Experiments:** randomization-based inference, `romano_wolf` for many-outcome
  family-wise control, and `mediate` for mediation (not naive controlling-away).
- **Sensitivity:** `oster_delta` / `sensemakr` for observational claims.

Report the effect size in interpretable units; route the full battery to the
appendix/supplement. A run end-to-end (synthetic data, real returns) is in the
[JF execution walkthrough](../../../Journal-of-Finance-Skills/resources/worked-examples/02-execution-walkthrough.md).
## Anti-patterns

- Naive TWFE on staggered treatment; clustering at the wrong level
- "Causal" language on a design that only supports association
- Convenience case selection dressed up as theory-driven
- A design whose results cannot be regenerated by a clean script (fails the replication check)

## Identification objections and the JOP-credible answer

A JOP referee asks the same question of every empirical design: would the result survive if the cleanest
rival story were true? Match the objection to the design move that closes it; keep diagnostics in the
Online Appendix.

| Referee objection | The design answer |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Leans on selection-on-observables" | Move to a counterfactual design (DID, IV, RDD) or show E-value/Oster bounds |
| "Parallel trends is asserted, not shown" | Event-study pre-trends plot; heterogeneity-robust estimator |
| "Exclusion restriction is doubtful" | Argue exclusion substantively; report first-stage F and weak-IV CIs |
| "Case selection is convenience" | Justify by design logic; say what the case is a case *of* |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A hypothetical paper claims a new transparency law cut local corruption, identifying off staggered
adoption across municipalities. A referee objects that early adopters were already cleaning up — a
selection story. The author answers structurally: an event study shows flat pre-trends, a
Callaway–Sant'Anna estimate gives a −0.6 SD drop, 95% CI [−1.0, −0.2] (illustrative), and an Oster bound
shows an unobserved confounder would need to be 1.7× the observed covariates to null the effect
(illustrative).

## Referee pushback patterns and the JOP fix

- *"Your causal claim outruns the design."* Either downgrade the language to association or add the design
  feature (counterfactual, instrument, discontinuity) that licenses the causal reading.
- *"This is not reproducible."* Choose estimators you can fully script; the analyst re-runs the code, so a
  bespoke hand-tuned procedure is a liability.

## Output format

```
【Mode】quant-causal / experiment / formal-empirical / qualitative
【Estimand or claim】what is being identified/shown
【Key assumption(s)】and how each is defended
【Rival ruled out】the adjudication sentence
【Replicable?】fully scriptable for the JOP analyst? [Y/N]
【Next】jop-data-analysis
```
