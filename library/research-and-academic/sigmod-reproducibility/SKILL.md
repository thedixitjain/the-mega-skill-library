# SIGMOD Reproducibility

PACMMOD's author guidelines state the culture plainly: sharing research
artifacts should be the norm, and papers are expected to make code, data,
scripts, and notebooks available where possible — encouraged rather than
mandatory for acceptance, but reviewers read availability as a credibility
signal. This skill covers reproducibility *as engineered into the paper*;
the post-acceptance badge process lives in `sigmod-artifact-evaluation`.

## Provenance chain, not vibes

A database paper's result is a function of code version, configuration,
dataset, workload, and hardware. Reproducibility means the paper pins all
five for every number it prints.

| Layer | Must be recoverable from paper + artifact | Where it usually hides |
|---|---|---|
| Code version | Commit or tag behind each experiment | "latest" at submission time |
| Configuration | Buffer sizes, thread counts, compaction/GC settings, flags | Defaults nobody recorded |
| Dataset | Source, version, generator seed, scale factor | "standard benchmark data" |
| Workload | Query mix, arrival pattern, skew parameters, warm/cold state | The harness script |
| Hardware | CPU model, cores, RAM, storage class, network, OS/kernel | A single sentence, if any |

The practical test: could a competent stranger fill this whole table from
your materials? Every empty cell is a review question waiting to be asked in
the feedback phase.

## Systems numbers need distributions

Throughput and latency are noisy. The SIGMOD-credible floor:

- Repeated runs with the repetition count stated; medians or means with a
  spread measure, never a single lucky run.
- Latency reported at named percentiles (p50/p95/p99), since tail behavior
  is often the actual contribution.
- Warm-up policy stated: what was cached, JIT-compiled, or pre-compacted
  before measurement started.
- Cross-run controls named: same machine, isolated tenancy, pinned cores,
  disabled turbo — whatever was actually done, said explicitly.

## Fairness to baselines is reproducibility too

The most contested numbers in a data-systems paper are the competitor's.
Record and disclose: which version of each baseline, who tuned it and how,
which of its features were enabled, and whether its authors' recommended
configuration was used. An artifact that reproduces *your* system but ships
an untuned strawman baseline reproduces the wrong thing.

## Repro debt ledger

Track gaps while writing rather than reconstructing at deadline:

```text
# repro-ledger.md (kept in the paper repo)
| Paper item | Script | Data pinned | Config pinned | Runs/variance | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Fig 6     | exp/f6.sh | yes (sf=100, seed 41) | yes | 5 runs, p50/p99 | OK |
| Fig 7     | exp/f7.sh | yes | NO — flags undocumented | 1 run | DEBT |
| Tab 2     | manual | partial | yes | n/a | DEBT: script it |
```

Rule: nothing with status DEBT appears in the submitted PDF. The ledger later
becomes the ARI claims map almost verbatim.

## Pinning, mechanically

The cheapest insurance is captured at run time, not reconstructed later:

```bash
# stamped into every experiment's log directory by the harness
git -C "$ENGINE_DIR" rev-parse HEAD          > meta/engine.commit
"$ENGINE" --dump-effective-config             > meta/config.effective
sha256sum data/*.bin                          > meta/datasets.sha256
lscpu; free -h; uname -r; nvme list          >> meta/hardware.txt
echo "$WORKLOAD_SEED $QUERY_MIX $SKEW"        > meta/workload.params
```

Five commands, and the provenance table fills itself for every figure. The
`--dump-effective-config` line matters most: defaults you never set are
still part of the experiment, and engines change defaults between versions.

## Data you cannot publish

Industrial collaborations often involve proprietary workloads. The accepted
pattern at SIGMOD: characterize the private data (sizes, distributions, skew,
schema shape), provide a public or synthetic stand-in that exhibits the same
phenomena, run headline experiments on both, and say which conclusions are
supported by the public path alone. A paper whose every claim requires
private data cannot be badged and will be read skeptically.

## Multi-round consistency

Because SIGMOD reviewing spans rounds, reproducibility discipline has a
second job: your own revision. Reviewers may demand new experiments with a
one-month window — regenerating the whole evaluation under a new flag is only
survivable if the original runs were scripted, seeded, and logged. Teams that
hand-ran their plots discover this during the revision, at the worst time.

## What reviewers can check without running anything

Even reviewers who never open the artifact test reproducibility passively:
do the numbers in the abstract, the results section, and the conclusion
agree; do figure axes and caption units match the prose; does the claimed
hardware plausibly fit the claimed dataset in memory; do percentages in
tables sum sensibly. Internal inconsistency is read as evidence that the
pipeline is hand-operated — and it usually is. A final numeric-consistency
pass over the PDF is reproducibility work, not copyediting.

## Output format

```text
[Sharing posture] full artifact / partial / withheld with stated reason
[Provenance table] complete cells vs. gaps, per figure and table
[Variance floor] repetitions, spread measures, percentile reporting
[Baseline fairness] versions, tuning provenance, config disclosure
[Private-data plan] public stand-in coverage of headline claims
[Debt ledger] items that must close before the round deadline
```
