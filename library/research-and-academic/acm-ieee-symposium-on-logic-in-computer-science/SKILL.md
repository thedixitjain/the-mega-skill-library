# ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)

## Conference positioning

ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) is a top computer-science conference venue for logic, semantics, type theory, automata, verification, proof theory, and theoretical CS. It rewards a logic paper with rigorous theorem contribution and clear computer-science relevance. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names LICS / ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science as the target venue.
- A manuscript in logic needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: logic, semantics, type theory, automata, verification, proof theory, and theoretical CS.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to LICS's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Treat LICS as a logic in CS venue whose reviewers expect the scope and evidence to match its own community. Do not submit a generic CS paper until the introduction names the exact subcommunity, contribution type, and proof or empirical standard.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: logic, semantics, type theory, automata, verification, proof theory, and theoretical CS.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: logic, semantics, type, theory, automata, verification, proof, theoretical, venue-specific, contribution, lics, siglog.
- Official anchor domain: lics.siglog.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Use this profile only when the manuscript's central contribution is genuinely in logic in CS
  and the author can say why LICS reviewers are the primary audience, not merely a convenient
  deadline.
- Closest roster neighbors to compare before final routing: `acm-sigplan-international-
  conference-on-functional-programming` (ICFP), `international-conference-on-computer-aided-
  verification` (CAV). Break ties by contribution type, evidence shape, reviewer community,
  and the current official CFP from lics.siglog.org.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **What LICS is.** The **ACM/IEEE** Symposium on **Logic in Computer Science** — foundational logic, semantics, type theory, automata.
- **vs CAV.** CAV is applied/algorithmic verification; LICS is the foundational-logic venue.
- **vs ICALP / STOC.** ICALP/STOC are broad theory; LICS is logic-focused.

## LICS-specific routing detail

- Prefer LICS when the contribution is logic in computer science: semantics, proof theory, type theory, automata/logic, verification foundations, category theory, or formal methods theory.
- Route empirical software repository mining to MSR, verification tooling to CAV, and programming-language implementation work to PLDI/ICFP when logic is not the core.
- LICS evidence should foreground definitions, theorems, proof structure, examples, and significance for logic/CS foundations.

## Method & evidence bar

- Use real programs, benchmarks, proofs, developer studies, or artifacts matched to the contribution type.
- For tools, report usability, scalability, false positives/negatives, and reproducible artifact details.
- For theory, provide precise definitions and complete proofs; for empirical SE, foreground validity threats.
- For LICS, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a logic paper with rigorous theorem contribution and clear computer-science relevance.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- State the software-engineering or language problem in terms of developer, program, proof, or runtime consequence.
- Keep examples small but nontrivial, then scale evidence to realistic code or formal benchmarks.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://lics.siglog.org/
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP / PCS / START or society portal, as specified for the current cycle.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at LICS, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle logic in CS papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Toy examples with no evidence on real programs or benchmarks.
- Tool paper without artifact clarity or comparison to current systems.
- Empirical claims without validity analysis or reproducible data pipeline.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving LICS reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses LICS's bar, compare against `international-conference-on-software-engineering` / `acm-international-conference-on-the-foundations-of-software-engineering` / `ieee-acm-international-conference-on-automated-software-engineering` / `acm-sigplan-conference-on-programming-language-design-and-implementation`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
```
