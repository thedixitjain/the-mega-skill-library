# The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology)

## Journal positioning

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JACI) is the flagship journal of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI), publishing clinical and mechanistic/translational research across allergy, asthma, and clinical immunology — atopic and respiratory allergic disease, food and drug allergy, urticaria, eosinophilic disorders, immunodeficiency, and the type 2 and broader immune mechanisms underlying these conditions. It serves allergists/immunologists and translational immunology scientists, and expects work that either changes allergy/asthma practice or delivers a clear, human-relevant immunologic mechanism; purely descriptive case series and bench studies with no allergic-disease anchor are a weak fit. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid; it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live JACI author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names JACI for an allergy, asthma, or clinical-immunology study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A study must be re-framed around an allergic-disease mechanism or a practice-relevant allergy/asthma question with human relevance.
- The author is choosing between JACI, a general-medicine or respiratory journal, and a basic-immunology venue.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and desk-reject expectations for allergy/immunology research.

## Scope & topic fit

- Asthma and allergic airway disease: phenotyping/endotyping, biologics, and type 2 inflammation mechanisms and trials.
- Food, drug, and venom allergy: diagnosis, oral immunotherapy and desensitization, and tolerance mechanisms.
- Atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, and other allergic skin disease — clinical and immunologic studies.
- Eosinophilic disorders, mast-cell disease, and rhinitis/rhinosinusitis with mechanistic or therapeutic advance.
- Primary and secondary immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation with clinical-immunology relevance.
- Translational immunology of allergic/immune disease (cytokine biology, barrier function, omics, immune cell profiling) anchored to human disease.

## Method & evidence bar

- Clinical studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-centered endpoints; biomarker/endotype endpoints need validation and justification.
- The applicable reporting guideline must be followed and its checklist supplied: CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews, STARD for diagnostic studies.
- Interventional and immunotherapy trials require prospective registration; the registration number and protocol/statistical-analysis plan are expected.
- Mechanistic/translational claims need rigorous controls, adequate replication, and validation in human samples or disease-relevant models, with appropriate immune-assay rigor (gating, isotype controls, quantification).
- Diagnostic and biomarker claims (e.g., allergy tests, endotype markers) require an independent validation cohort and an accepted reference standard.
- Observational and cohort analyses must address confounding, atopic comorbidity, and missing data; causal language must match the design.

## Structure & house style

- AAAAI/Elsevier format with a structured abstract and a concise clinical-implication/capsule summary where required; re-check current article types and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames a focused allergy/immunology question and its mechanistic or clinical importance; the discussion states the practice or mechanistic implication plainly.
- Figures must include the controls, replication, and quantification supporting each immunologic claim; CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagrams are expected where applicable.
- Supplements carry the protocol, full immunologic methods and reagent details, and additional cohorts/analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and AAAAI anchors, then cite the current JACI page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guide for authors" and follow the current AAAAI/Elsevier version.
- Re-check article types, word/figure limits, structured-abstract and capsule-summary format, and statistical/immune-assay reporting requirements.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD), data-sharing statement, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent, animal-use approval where relevant, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study answers a focused allergy/immunology question with a clear mechanistic or practice implication and human relevance.
- [ ] Clinical endpoints are prespecified and patient-centered; biomarker/endotype endpoints are validated.
- [ ] Mechanistic claims rest on adequately controlled, replicated immune assays, ideally validated in human samples.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Immunotherapy/interventional trials are prospectively registered with the number in the manuscript; protocol/SAP provided.
- [ ] IRB/consent, ICMJE disclosures, and a data-sharing statement are prepared.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Descriptive case series or cohort slices with no mechanistic or practice advance.
- Mechanistic claims from a single model or cell line with no human validation and weak immune-assay controls.
- Biomarker/diagnostic studies without an independent validation cohort or reference standard.
- Missing trial/immunotherapy registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Observational analyses with inadequate confounding/comorbidity handling or overstated causal claims.
- Basic immunology with no allergic-disease anchor, better served by a dedicated immunology venue.

## Re-routing decision

- Respiratory-medicine emphasis where asthma/airway outcome dominates over allergy mechanism → `the-lancet-respiratory-medicine`.
- Rheumatology/autoimmune musculoskeletal focus → `arthritis-and-rheumatology`.
- Practice-changing, broadly significant trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
- Pure basic immunology with no allergic-disease translation → a basic-science immunology venue in the natural-science bundle.
- Dermatology-dominant atopic disease with no immune mechanism → a specialty dermatology venue.
