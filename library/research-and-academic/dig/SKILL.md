# Dig Deeper

## When To Use

- Drilling into a subtopic after an initial research session
- Narrowing results to a specific channel (e.g. papers only)

## When NOT To Use

- Starting a new research topic (use `/tome:research` first)
- Synthesizing results (use `/tome:synthesize`)

Refine an active research session interactively.

## Workflow

1. Load most recent session via SessionManager
2. Parse the subtopic and optional channel filter
3. Dispatch targeted search (single agent or all channels)
4. Merge new findings into existing session
5. Re-rank and update the saved report
6. Present new findings to user

## Error Cases

- No active session: "Start a session first with
  `/tome:research \"topic\"`"
- Specified channel not in original session: warn and
  suggest available channels

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Active session loaded from SessionManager before any search
      executes; if absent, error "Start a session first with
      `/tome:research \"<topic>\"`" is emitted and skill halts
- [ ] New findings merged into the existing session without
      overwriting prior findings from other channels
- [ ] Session report re-ranked and saved after the merge so
      the updated file reflects the deeper search results
- [ ] If the specified channel is not in the original session,
      a warning is emitted listing the available channels
- [ ] New findings presented to the user after the session is
      saved, not before
