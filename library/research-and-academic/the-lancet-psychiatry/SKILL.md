# The Lancet Psychiatry (the-lancet-psychiatry)

## Journal positioning

The Lancet Psychiatry is a Lancet specialty journal for high-impact clinical and
population research across psychiatry and mental health — mood, anxiety, psychotic, and
neurodevelopmental disorders, substance use, child and adolescent and old-age
psychiatry, and the mental-health consequences of physical illness and social
adversity. It favors **practice- or policy-changing randomized trials, large cohorts,
and population/epidemiological analyses with global reach and mental-health-systems
relevance**, with a strong emphasis on rigorous design, patient-important outcomes, and
attention to stigma, equity, and lived experience. Small single-site studies,
mechanistic neuroscience without a clinical or population endpoint, and underpowered
intervention pilots are a weak fit and belong in a specialist psychiatry or
neuroscience venue. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid; it is
not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current
instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live The Lancet Psychiatry
author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names The Lancet Psychiatry for a psychiatry or mental-health
  clinical/population study and wants a fit/framing check.
- A trial or cohort must be re-framed around a globally relevant, practice- or
  policy-changing mental-health question.
- The author is choosing between The Lancet Psychiatry, JAMA Psychiatry, and a
  specialist psychiatry journal.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and desk-reject
  expectations for mental-health evidence.

## Scope & topic fit

- Randomized trials of psychological, pharmacological, digital, and service-level
  interventions for mental disorders, with patient-important outcomes.
- Large prospective cohorts and high-quality observational studies on mental-disorder
  incidence, course, prognosis, and outcomes at scale.
- Population, epidemiological, and global-mental-health studies, including low- and
  middle-income settings and health-equity framing.
- Mental-health-services, policy, and implementation research with system-level
  relevance.
- Studies on the mental-health effects of physical illness, social adversity, and
  inequalities, and on stigma and lived experience, with rigorous methods.
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses resolving a focused, clinically or policy
  consequential mental-health question.

## Method & evidence bar

- Trials must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-important primary
  outcomes (validated symptom or functioning measures, remission, quality of life);
  outcome-measure choice and blinding feasibility must be justified.
- The applicable reporting guideline and completed checklist are expected: CONSORT
  (incl. for non-pharmacological/psychological interventions) for trials, STROBE for
  observational studies, PRISMA for systematic reviews.
- Trials require prospective registration; the registration number, protocol, and
  statistical-analysis plan are expected; patient and public involvement is valued.
- Observational and epidemiological claims must address confounding, reverse causation,
  selection bias, and missing data; causal language must match the design.
- Effect estimates need confidence intervals and clinically meaningful (not only
  statistically significant) thresholds; generalizability across settings and cultures
  should be argued.
- Multi-site, international, and registry-scale evidence strengthens fit; underpowered
  single-site pilots rarely clear the bar.

## Structure & house style

- Lancet specialty format with a structured summary and a Research in context /
  evidence-before-this-study panel; re-check current article types and limits on the
  live guide.
- The introduction frames the global clinical or policy gap in mental health; the
  discussion states the practice or policy consequence and limitations plainly.
- A CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagram is expected where applicable; non-stigmatizing,
  person-first language and attention to lived experience are expected.
- The role of the funding source statement and a data-sharing statement are expected;
  appendices carry protocol, full statistical methods, and additional analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and Lancet
  anchors, then cite the current The Lancet Psychiatry page you checked.
- Search the live site for "The Lancet Psychiatry information for authors" and follow the
  current version.
- Re-check article types, structured-summary and Research in context format, and
  word/reference/figure limits.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA),
  protocol/SAP, the role-of-funding-source statement, and data-sharing statement.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent (including capacity and vulnerable-population
  safeguards), ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use
  disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study answers a globally relevant, practice- or policy-changing mental-health question.
- [ ] The primary outcome is prespecified, validated, and patient-important; the study is adequately powered.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Trials are prospectively registered with the number in the manuscript; protocol/SAP provided.
- [ ] Confounding, reverse causation, and missing data are addressed; causal language matches the design.
- [ ] Ethics/consent (capacity, vulnerable populations), ICMJE disclosures, role-of-funding-source, and a data-sharing statement are prepared.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Underpowered single-site pilots or feasibility studies presented as definitive.
- Mechanistic neuroscience or neuroimaging with no clinical or population mental-health endpoint.
- Non-validated or idiosyncratic outcome measures without justification or clinical anchoring.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Observational analyses with unaddressed reverse causation or overstated causal claims.
- Narrow or locally bounded scope without global or policy relevance; stigmatizing framing or language.

## Re-routing decision

- JAMA Network family or US-centric clinical psychiatry framing → `jama-psychiatry`.
- Population mental-health research without a clinical/service endpoint and with broad public-health framing → `the-lancet-public-health`.
- Mental-health comorbidity of metabolic disease as the core contribution → `the-lancet-diabetes-and-endocrinology`.
- Mechanistic psychiatric neuroscience → a specialist psychiatry or neuroscience journal.
- Broad, practice-changing significance beyond psychiatry → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
