# AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)

## Conference positioning

AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is a top computer-science conference venue for broad artificial intelligence across reasoning, learning, search, knowledge, agents, and applications. It rewards a general-AI contribution whose interest is broader than a single narrow subcommunity. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names AAAI / AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence as the target venue.
- A manuscript in broad artificial intelligence across reasoning needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: broad artificial intelligence across reasoning, learning, search, knowledge, agents, and applications.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to AAAI's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Treat AAAI as a broad AAAI main-track venue: reasoning, search, planning, agents, knowledge, learning, applications, and AI-and-society all compete under a general AI umbrella. A submission should communicate beyond a single ML subcommunity.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: broad artificial intelligence across reasoning, learning, search, knowledge, agents, and applications.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: broad, artificial, intelligence, across, reasoning, learning, search, knowledge, agents, applications, venue-specific, contribution, flagship, aaai.
- Official anchor domain: aaai.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Use this profile only when the manuscript's central contribution is genuinely in AI/ML
  flagship and the author can say why AAAI reviewers are the primary audience, not merely a
  convenient deadline.
- Closest roster neighbors to compare before final routing: `international-conference-on-
  machine-learning` (ICML), `international-conference-on-learning-representations` (ICLR),
  `international-joint-conference-on-artificial-intelligence` (IJCAI), `artificial-
  intelligence-and-statistics` (AISTATS). Break ties by contribution type, evidence shape,
  reviewer community, and the current official CFP from aaai.org.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **What AAAI is.** The **AAAI**-sponsored broad AI flagship, North-America-centered, very large and topic-wide.
- **vs IJCAI.** IJCAI (International Joint Conferences on AI) is the **global** generalist AI flagship; route by cycle and community, both are AI-wide.
- **vs ECAI.** ECAI (EurAI) is the **European** generalist AI conference; reserve domain venues (NeurIPS/ICML/CVPR/ACL) for method-specific work.

## AAAI-specific routing detail

- Prefer AAAI when the paper is broad AI research for a general AI audience: reasoning, planning, learning, search, NLP, vision, agents, ethics, or applications with clear AI novelty.
- Route international AI flagship cycle/community fit to IJCAI, European AI fit to ECAI, and narrow ML method papers to ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR when ML reviewers are primary.
- AAAI evidence should make the AI contribution, task scope, baselines, generality, and cross-area relevance explicit.

## Method & evidence bar

- Compare against current strong baselines and explain exactly what changes in the algorithm, objective, data, or inference procedure.
- Report ablations that isolate the claimed mechanism; do not rely on aggregate benchmark wins alone.
- Document data, compute, hyperparameters, model selection, and failure cases so the result can be reviewed as science rather than demo output.
- For AAAI, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a general-AI contribution whose interest is broader than a single narrow subcommunity.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- Frame the contribution as a reusable idea: method, theory, benchmark, dataset, system, or socio-technical finding.
- Separate main claims from exploratory results; reviewers at top AI venues punish overclaiming and hidden cherry-picking.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP / PCS / START or society portal, as specified for the current cycle.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at AAAI, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle AI/ML flagship papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Leaderboard-only novelty with weak explanation of why the method works.
- Unclear data contamination, missing baselines, or evaluation that cannot be reproduced.
- Claims about safety, fairness, health, or society without matching evidence and limitations.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving AAAI reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses AAAI's bar, compare against `neural-information-processing-systems` / `international-conference-on-machine-learning` / `international-conference-on-learning-representations` / `international-joint-conference-on-artificial-intelligence`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
