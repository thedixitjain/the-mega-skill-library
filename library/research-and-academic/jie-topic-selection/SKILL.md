# Topic Selection (jie-topic-selection)

## When to trigger

- You are deciding whether a paper belongs at JIE vs a general-interest or domestic-field journal
- The international-economics angle is unclear or bolted-on
- You are unsure your motivation or model is original enough to clear JIE's gate

## JIE's scope

JIE publishes work across the whole of international economics — **both international trade and international macroeconomics/finance**. In-scope topics, per the journal's stated scope, include: trade patterns and commercial policy; international institutions; exchange rates; open-economy macroeconomics; country/regional growth and development; international finance; international pricing; sovereign debt; international factor mobility; spatial economics; and international monetary and fiscal theory and policy. A paper must have a genuine **international dimension** — a closed-economy labor or public-finance result, however clean, is off-fit unless the cross-border mechanism is central.

## The originality gate

JIE accepts both empirical and theoretical work, but only if it is **original in its motivation or modelling structure**. This is the screen that desk-rejects roughly a quarter of submissions. Ask:

- **Motivation originality**: does the paper ask a new international-economics question, use new data, or expose a fact the field did not have? (e.g., a new tariff/NTM dataset, firm-level export dynamics, a novel exchange-rate or capital-flow measure.)
- **Modelling originality**: does the paper build or extend structure in a non-trivial way? (e.g., a new mechanism in an Eaton–Kortum / Melitz trade model, a new ingredient in a sovereign-default or small-open-economy DSGE.)
- A competent re-run of a known design on a new country/period, with neither motivation nor modelling novelty, will not clear the gate.

## Two-sided fit check

- **Trade side**: gravity/structural-trade, commercial policy, GVCs, spatial/economic-geography. Editors include trade specialists (Arkolakis, Eaton, Rodriguez-Clare, Staiger).
- **Macro/finance side**: exchange rates, open-economy macro, sovereign debt, international pricing, capital flows. Editors include macro/finance specialists (Uribe, Engel).
- Knowing which half you are in tells you which (Co-)Editor to suggest at submission.

## Anti-patterns

- A domestic result with a thin "and we use cross-country data" veneer
- A paper whose only novelty is a new country/sample for a settled question
- A structural paper that re-skins an existing model without a new mechanism
- Pitching to JIE as if it were a general-interest top-5 "big lesson" outlet

## Scope-fit decision table

Run a candidate through this grid first. The cross-border mechanism must be central, not decorative, and the originality axis (motivation or modelling) must be nameable in one line.

| Candidate framing | Int'l dimension | JIE verdict | Sibling if off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tariff/RTA shock on firm exports (gravity/shift-share) | Central | In-scope, trade | — |
| Exchange-rate pass-through into import prices | Central | In-scope, macro-finance | JIMF if finance-mechanics |
| Sovereign-default model, new renegotiation channel | Central | In-scope, macro-finance | JME if monetary-focused |
| Domestic minimum-wage effect, no trade margin | Absent | Off-fit | JOLE / labour |
| Cross-country growth regression, no transmission | Veneer | Likely desk-reject | JDE if development-driven |

A rightmost-column row means route the paper there before polishing for JIE.

## Desk-reject patterns this gate catches

The originality screen turns away a meaningful share of submissions (confirm the current desk-reject figure against the journal's editor pages). Recurring failures: settled-question replication (a known elasticity re-estimated on a fresh panel); bolted-on internationalism (a closed-economy result whose mechanism stays domestic); re-skinned structure (a model recalibrated, not extended); and wrong-venue ambition (a "lesson for macro" pitch reading as general-interest).

## Worked vignette (illustrative)

A draft proposes: "We estimate the effect of the 2018–2019 US–China tariff escalation on Chinese firms' export values using customs microdata and a shift-share exposure measure." Walk the gate:

- **International dimension**: central — commercial policy through firm-level trade. Pass. **Scope half**: trade.
- **Motivation originality**: firm-level customs records on a large policy shock is a credible new-data angle — *provisionally* original, conditional on what existing China-shock and tariff-war papers already report.
- **Modelling originality**: not claimed; reduced-form. JIE needs originality on *one* axis, not both.
- **Verdict**: fits the trade half on motivation originality, *if* the literature check confirms the firm-level tariff-war margin is not saturated. An illustrative target magnitude — an export decline of a few percentage points per SD of tariff exposure — must be economically, not just statistically, meaningful (numbers illustrative).
