# Algorithm & Model Formulation (ijoc-theory-development)

## When to trigger

- An algorithm "works" empirically but its **statement, invariants, and termination** are not written down rigorously
- A formulation is proposed but its **validity** (the model exactly captures the problem; the cuts are valid; the relaxation is correct) is asserted, not argued
- A referee asks for **complexity, convergence, approximation ratio, or correctness** and the paper has none
- A heuristic or ML method needs the **theoretical scaffolding** (what it guarantees, when it can fail) that distinguishes IJOC from a pure benchmark paper

## What "theory" means at IJOC

IJOC is not a pure-theory journal, but it expects the **method to be defined and defended**, not just demonstrated. The advance is computational, yet referees want to know *why the method is correct* and *what it provably achieves* before they trust the experiments. Match the rigor to the archetype — an exact method needs validity and finiteness; a heuristic needs a clear procedure and, where possible, bounds; an ML-for-OR method needs a stated learning task and a guarantee or a falsifiable claim. The theory and the experiments must agree: a proven worst case should be visible in the runtime-vs-size plot.

## Branch paths

### Branch A: Exact methods (B&B / B&C / B&P, decomposition)
- **State the formulation precisely** and prove it is a valid model of the problem (feasible region = exactly the intended solutions).
- **Prove validity of cuts / columns / Benders cuts**; show the separation/pricing problem and its complexity.
- **Argue finite termination / correctness** of the algorithm; state the relaxation and any bound-tightening.
- **Complexity:** give the per-iteration cost and, where possible, worst-case size; if NP-hard, say so and motivate the empirical study that follows.

### Branch B: Heuristics / metaheuristics / matheuristics
- **Write the procedure as pseudocode** with explicit neighborhood/operators, acceptance rule, and stopping criterion — reproducibility starts here.
- **State guarantees where they exist:** approximation ratio, performance bound, local-optimality conditions; if none, say the contribution is empirical and design the experiments to earn that claim.
- **Argue why the design fits the structure** of the problem (what the operator exploits), not just "it performed well."

### Branch C: Machine learning for OR / learning-to-optimize
- **Define the learning task and the loss** precisely; state what is learned and what is solved exactly.
- **Generalization claim:** state the distribution of instances and what is claimed to transfer; provide a guarantee or a falsifiable out-of-distribution test plan.
- **Feasibility/optimality safeguards:** if a learned policy can produce infeasible or arbitrarily bad solutions, state the repair/guarantee that prevents it.

### Branch D: Simulation / computational probability
- **Specify the model and estimator**; state unbiasedness/consistency and the variance behavior.
- **Variance reduction:** state the technique (CRN, control variates, importance sampling) and prove or argue it reduces variance for this estimand.
- **Convergence / error bounds** for the computational scheme; state regularity assumptions.

## Checklist

- [ ] Branch chosen; the method is stated as a formal formulation or pseudocode, not prose only
- [ ] Exact: model validity proven; cuts/columns valid; finite termination/correctness argued; complexity stated
- [ ] Heuristic: full pseudocode; bounds stated where they exist; design tied to problem structure
- [ ] ML-for-OR: learning task + loss defined; generalization claim falsifiable; feasibility safeguard stated
- [ ] Simulation: estimator properties + variance-reduction justification given
- [ ] Every theorem has assumptions stated and a proof (main text or supplement, but referenced)
- [ ] The theoretical claim and the experimental claim do not contradict each other

## Anti-patterns

- "The algorithm converged / it works" presented as if it were correctness or a guarantee
- Asserting cut/column validity without proof — a fatal flaw for an exact-methods paper
- A heuristic with no pseudocode, so neither referee nor the GitHub deposit can reproduce it
- An ML-for-OR method that can return infeasible solutions with no stated safeguard
- Claiming an approximation ratio that the experiments quietly violate
- Burying the proof of a key result in a supplement the main paper depends on (keep the main paper self-contained on its central claims)

## Worked vignette (illustrative)

A paper proposes new valid inequalities for a stochastic facility-location MIP and a branch-and-cut that uses them. A weak version says "the cuts helped." An IJOC version: state the polyhedral result (the inequalities are facet-defining under a stated condition), give the separation algorithm and its O(n log n) cost, and prove they are valid for the original feasible region. Then the experiments are interpretable — the root-gap closure (say 31%, illustrative) and the node-count reduction are *predicted* by the theory, not surprises.
