# Topic Selection & Venue Fit (jle-topic-selection)

## When to trigger

- A project analyzes a law, a regulation, a court, or a legal institution economically, but you are unsure it is "JLE-shaped"
- The question reads like doctrinal legal scholarship, an organizational-governance study, or a generic applied-micro paper — and you need to place it
- The same dataset (court records, enforcement actions, statute panels) supports several framings and you must pick the one that lands here
- A co-author asks "why JLE and not the Journal of Legal Studies or JLEO?"

## The JLE fit test

JLE wants **economic analysis of law, regulation, and legal institutions** where a **real legal/regulatory question** is answered with a **credible empirical design or a disciplined theoretical model**, in the Chicago price-theory-plus-institutions tradition. The legal rule or institution must be load-bearing — not background color for a generic economics paper, and not a doctrinal argument dressed in regression.

| Signal in your project | Likely fit |
|------------------------|-----------|
| A legal rule / regulation / enforcement regime changes behavior, and you identify the effect credibly | **JLE** (core) |
| The contribution is primarily doctrinal or normative-legal, lightly empirical | lean **Journal of Legal Studies** (also UChicago, more legal/doctrinal) |
| The question is about organizations, governance, or positive political economy / institutions-as-equilibria | lean **JLEO** |
| Solid law-and-econ but incremental, field-internal, or a shorter contribution | **American Law and Economics Review** |
| The legal angle is incidental; it is really labor/public/IO with a law label | a **field journal** or AEJ, not JLE |
| Pure mechanism-design / contract theory with no legal institution | a **theory journal**, not JLE |

JLE is **question-first and institution-respecting**: an empirical paper needs the rule's mechanics right (who is bound, when it binds, what the counterfactual rule is); a theory paper needs comparative statics about a legal rule that someone could in principle test or recognize in the world.

## Sharpening the question (do this before writing anything)

1. **One-sentence legal/economic question** with the rule and the object named: "What is the effect of legal rule R on outcome Y for agents A, identified by [the change/threshold/assignment]?"
2. **Why a law-and-economics audience cares** — name the regulatory or doctrinal debate the answer informs (e.g., damages caps and litigation, merger policy and prices, sentencing and deterrence).
3. **The institutional detail that makes it real** — when does the rule bind, who is exempt, what is the counterfactual legal regime; if you cannot state this, the topic is not yet JLE-shaped.
4. **The credible-design or model seed** — a law change, a threshold, a court/case assignment, an enforcement event, or a model whose comparative statics are testable; if none, route to `jle-identification` or `jle-theory-model`.

## Checklist

- [ ] One-sentence question naming the legal rule/institution and the economic outcome
- [ ] Venue placed against the table; the reason it is JLE and not JLS / JLEO / ALER written in one line
- [ ] The legal-institutional mechanics stated (who is bound, when it binds, the counterfactual rule)
- [ ] The regulatory or doctrinal debate the answer speaks to, named
- [ ] A candidate design (law change / threshold / assignment / enforcement event) or a testable model
- [ ] No causal overclaim from a design that cannot support it, and no doctrinal argument standing in for evidence

## Anti-patterns

- A generic applied-micro paper with a thin legal label sent to JLE for "fit" — desk-reject risk
- Doctrinal/normative legal argument with token regressions (belongs at JLS, or is not yet a JLE paper)
- An organizations / positive-political-economy study that is really JLEO-shaped
- "Interesting court dataset, no question" — data availability is not a contribution
- Getting the institution wrong (treating a non-binding rule as binding, ignoring exemptions or enforcement gaps)

## Worked vignette (illustrative)

A researcher has scraped two decades of state appellate decisions and wants to "study judges and the economy." That is a dataset, not a question. Working through the fit test: the cleanest variation is the staggered random assignment of cases to judges with measurably different priors — a court-assignment design. The question becomes "what is the effect of being assigned a pro-defendant judge on firm investment after a contract dispute, identified by random case assignment?" The doctrinal debate is whether judicial discretion creates legal uncertainty that chills investment; the institution is real (assignment rules, recusal, appeal). Now it is JLE-shaped — and clearly not a doctrinal JLS note or a JLEO governance study.

## The field areas JLE is built for

A project lands more naturally if it sits in one of JLE's historical strengths. Use this to confirm the question is recognizably law-and-economics:

- **Antitrust & competition** — merger effects, collusion, market definition, the economics of enforcement and consent decrees
- **Regulation & its incidence** — who bears the cost of a rule, capture, the Stigler/Peltzman theory of regulation, deregulation episodes
- **Crime & deterrence** — the Becker margin (probability × severity), sentencing, enforcement intensity, recidivism
- **Property & contract** — entitlements and bargaining (Coase), contract enforcement, property-rights regimes
- **Corporate & securities law** — disclosure rules, governance mandates, securities enforcement, litigation
- **Litigation & courts** — selection of disputes (Priest–Klein), fee rules, damages caps, judicial behavior
- **Intellectual property** — patent/copyright scope, infringement, innovation incentives
- **Political economy of law** — lawmaking, lobbying, the supply of legal rules

If the question does not sit in or adjacent to one of these, re-examine whether the legal institution is really load-bearing.

## Sibling-placement quick test

- Is the deliverable an *economic effect of a legal rule*, credibly identified? → **JLE**
- Is it primarily a doctrinal or normative-legal argument? → **Journal of Legal Studies**
- Is it about organizations, governance, or institutions-as-equilibria? → **JLEO**
- Is it solid but incremental law-and-econ? → **American Law and Economics Review**
- Would a non-law economist cite it without caring about the rule? → a **field journal**, not JLE

## Output format
