# Engineering & technology journal workflow (en-engtech-journal-workflow)

## Purpose

This is the routing skill for the engineering bundle. It does not replace a
single-journal profile; it first classifies the manuscript by **engineering
sub-discipline, contribution type, and validation shape**, then routes into the
matching per-journal skill for fit and re-framing. It is a sibling to
`en-natsci-journal-workflow` (natural science) and `en-journal-workflow`
(econ/finance/management).

## Ask four things first

1. **Sub-discipline:** electrical/EECS, control, communications/information theory,
   signal processing, power/energy systems, robotics, photonics/optics, electronics
   devices, biomedical engineering, mechanics/solids, fluids, manufacturing,
   aerospace, chemical/process engineering, energy conversion/storage, materials
   engineering, or civil/transportation?
2. **Contribution type:** a theorem/bound, a new algorithm/method, a system or
   architecture, a device/material with measured performance, a tutorial/survey, or
   a design methodology?
3. **Validation shape:** mathematical proof, numerical simulation, controlled bench
   experiment, hardware prototype, pilot/field deployment, or standardized
   materials/mechanical testing?
4. **Audience breadth:** the whole field (Proceedings of the IEEE, a Nature
   Portfolio engineering title), a sub-discipline community (an IEEE Transactions,
   Automatica, JFM, Acta Materialia), or a specialty niche?

## Sibling-journal disambiguation

| Confusable targets | Decision rule |
|---|---|
| `ieee-transactions-on-automatic-control` vs `automatica` | Both are top control venues; TAC leans toward rigorous theory and shorter technical notes, Automatica toward methodological breadth — route by the form of the main result and re-check current scopes. |
| `ieee-transactions-on-robotics` vs `the-international-journal-of-robotics-research` | T-RO favors complete, validated robotics contributions; IJRR favors longer, conceptually framed archival work — route by contribution length and framing. |
| `optica` vs `light-science-and-applications` | Both are high-impact photonics; decide whether the advance is best framed for the Optica/OSA optics community or the Nature Portfolio breadth audience. |
| Nature-Portfolio engineering (`nature-electronics`/`nature-biomedical-engineering`) vs IEEE Transactions | Nature titles need field-changing significance and broad framing; a complete, rigorous specialty result routes to the matching IEEE Transactions. |
| `acta-materialia` vs the materials/energy titles in the natural-science bundle (`advanced-materials`, `nature-materials`) | Route structural/processing metallurgy to Acta Materialia; conceptual functional-materials advances to the Nature/Advanced family. |
| `applied-energy` vs `journal-of-power-sources`/`energy-storage-materials` | Systems-level energy integration → Applied Energy; device-level electrochemical power/storage → the power-source/storage titles. |

## Decision rules

- **Name the engineering contribution.** "We built/measured X" is not a contribution
  unless it advances a method, a bound, a design principle, or a performance frontier
  with a reproducible margin over the right baseline.
- **Baseline and benchmark discipline.** Performance claims need comparison to the
  current state of the art under stated, reproducible conditions — not to a strawman.
- **Theory vs. system.** A theorem/bound, a method with guarantees, and a deployed
  system are different products; pick the reviewer community that evaluates the main
  claim.
- **Survey/tutorial venues are mostly invited or scoped** (Proceedings of the IEEE,
  Progress in Materials Science / Aerospace Sciences / Energy and Combustion
  Science) — do not route an unsolicited primary-data paper there without checking
  scope.
- **Reproducibility/data/code** expectations are now standard in engineering — a
  results paper without enough to reproduce the key claim is a common reject.
- Always enter the single-journal skill's official-submission checklist before
  submitting; never rely on a stale template.

## Output format

```text
[Top journal skill] <skill-name>
[Alt 1] <skill-name> (reason)
[Alt 2] <skill-name> (reason)
[Do not submit to] <journal> (one-line mismatch reason)
[Biggest current gap] contribution-clarity / baseline / validation / reproducibility / formatting / official requirements
[Next step] invoke <skill-name> for single-venue fit and re-framing
```
