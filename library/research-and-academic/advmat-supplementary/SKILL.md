# Advanced Materials Supporting Information (advmat-supplementary)

## When to trigger

- The manuscript is over the Communication/Article format and detail must move out of the body
- A reader cannot judge the material without opening the SI
- You have extended datasets, full recipes, or control experiments with no home
- You are unsure what belongs in the SI versus what must stay in the main text
- Reviewers of a prior version asked for data that would bloat the body

## The stand-alone rule (non-negotiable)

The main text must be **fully understandable and convincing on its own**. The Supporting Information *supports* the paper; it must never be *load-bearing* for the central advance. A reader who never opens the SI should still grasp the material, the decisive evidence that it is what you claim, the property, and the benchmarked function.

- The central advance, the decisive characterization, and the headline benchmarked metric live in the **main text**.
- The SI holds the exhaustive backup a skeptical referee or a group trying to reproduce the work will want.
- Every SI item is **cited from the main text** at the point it becomes relevant.

If removing the SI collapses the argument, the partition is wrong — pull the essential piece back into the main text (and trim elsewhere via `advmat-length-management`).

## What belongs in Supporting Information

| Content                                             | Home       |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Full synthesis recipes, optimization sweeps          | SI         |
| Extended characterization (more samples, techniques) | SI         |
| Full device fabrication protocols, control devices   | SI         |
| Complete benchmarking table with all references      | SI         |
| Per-sample statistics, histograms, batch data        | SI         |
| Additional figures, movies, large data tables        | SI         |
| DFT/computational details, input files               | SI         |
| The central advance and its decisive evidence        | Main text  |
| The property mechanism linking structure to function | Main text  |
| The headline benchmarked metric with n and spread    | Main text  |

## SI organization

- Mirror the main text's logic: order SI sections to match the order they are cited.
- Give SI sections clear headings and self-contained captions; label SI figures/tables distinctly (Figure S1, Table S1).
- Include an SI Experimental Section detailed enough to reproduce the material if the main-text version is condensed.
- Keep the SI honest: it is peer-reviewed alongside the paper — not a place to bury weak or contradictory data.
- Provide computational and raw-data availability per current Wiley policy (repository + DOI where required).

## Checklist

- [ ] The main text is convincing without ever opening the SI
- [ ] No decisive evidence for the advance lives *only* in the SI
- [ ] Every SI item is cited from the main text at the relevant point
- [ ] SI sections ordered to match their citation order
- [ ] SI figures/tables labeled S1, S2, ... distinctly from main-text items
- [ ] The full reproducible recipe/protocol is in the SI if condensed in the body
- [ ] Nomenclature and units are consistent between main text and SI
- [ ] Data/computational availability handled per current Wiley policy

## Anti-patterns

- A paper that silently depends on the SI to be believed
- Burying the decisive characterization or the benchmarking in the SI
- An SI that is a disorganized data dump rather than a structured appendix
- SI figures referenced out of order or never cited from the body
- Nomenclature/unit drift between main text and SI
- Using the SI to smuggle in claims the referees did not scrutinize

## Output format

```
【Main text stands alone】yes / fix (pull back: ...)
【SI sections】S1: ... / S2: ... (cited from body?)
【Decisive evidence only in SI?】none / move back: ...
【SI figure/table labels】S-prefixed?  yes / fix
【Reproducible recipe present】yes / fix
【Nomenclature consistent body↔SI】yes / fix
【Next】advmat-writing-style or advmat-length-management
```
