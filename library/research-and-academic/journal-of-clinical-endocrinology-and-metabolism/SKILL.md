# Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (journal-of-clinical-endocrinology-and-metabolism)

## Journal positioning

The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM, Endocrine Society / Oxford
University Press) is the Endocrine Society's flagship clinical journal, publishing
research across the **full breadth of clinical endocrinology and metabolism** — thyroid,
adrenal, pituitary/neuroendocrine, bone and mineral, reproductive endocrinology,
obesity, lipid, and diabetes/metabolism — with an emphasis on human, patient-oriented
studies that inform endocrine diagnosis and management. Its defining expectation is a
**clinically important advance in the diagnosis, treatment, or pathophysiology of an
endocrine or metabolic disorder in humans**, not a narrow single-center series, a pure
animal study with no human translation, or a diabetes-only paper better placed in a
dedicated diabetes journal. Breadth across endocrine organs is a feature: JCEM is the
generalist endocrine venue. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid;
it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current
instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live JCEM author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names JCEM for a clinical-endocrinology or metabolism study across any
  endocrine organ system and wants a fit/framing check.
- An endocrine study must be re-framed around a patient-oriented diagnostic, therapeutic,
  or pathophysiologic question.
- The author is choosing between JCEM (broad endocrine), Diabetologia (diabetes-specific),
  and The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (high-impact trials).
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and human-endocrine-study
  expectations.

## Scope & topic fit

- Thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary/neuroendocrine disorders: diagnosis, hormone assays,
  and management studies.
- Bone, mineral, and calcium metabolism: osteoporosis, parathyroid, and vitamin-D
  endocrinology.
- Reproductive and developmental endocrinology: PCOS, hypogonadism, fertility, and
  pubertal/growth disorders.
- Obesity, lipid, and energy metabolism with endocrine mechanism or clinical management
  endpoints.
- Diabetes and glucose metabolism as part of broad endocrine practice (with awareness of
  diabetes-dedicated venues).
- Endocrine clinical trials, cohorts, biomarker/hormone-assay validation, and
  pharmacologic/hormone-therapy studies in humans.

## Method & evidence bar

- Studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-centered endocrine
  endpoints; surrogate hormone endpoints need clinical justification.
- The applicable reporting guideline and checklist are expected: CONSORT for trials,
  STROBE for observational work, PRISMA for systematic reviews, STARD for diagnostic/assay
  accuracy.
- Trials require prospective registration and the registration number; protocol/SAP are
  expected.
- Hormone assays and biomarker methods must be validated and described (platform,
  reference intervals, harmonization); analytic rigor is scrutinized.
- Observational claims must address confounding, bias, and missing data; causal language
  must match the design.
- Effect estimates need confidence intervals and absolute as well as relative measures;
  clinical significance must be argued.

## Structure & house style

- Endocrine Society/OUP format with a structured abstract and a precis/context-and-significance
  statement; re-check current article types (Clinical Research Article, etc.) and limits on
  the live guide.
- The introduction frames the endocrine clinical question; the discussion states the
  diagnostic or management implication plainly.
- A CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD flow diagram is expected for the relevant design.
- Tables/figures follow the journal's statistical-reporting standards; a supplement carries
  the protocol, full assay/statistical methods, and additional analyses.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and Endocrine
  Society/OUP anchors, then cite the current JCEM page you checked.
- Search the live site for "JCEM Endocrine Society instructions for authors" and follow
  the current version.
- Re-check article types, abstract and precis format, and word/figure/reference limits.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD),
  assay-validation reporting, data/code-availability, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure,
  funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study answers a patient-oriented endocrine diagnostic, therapeutic, or pathophysiologic question.
- [ ] Endocrine endpoints are prespecified and powered; trials are registered with the number in the manuscript.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Hormone assays/biomarkers are validated and fully described.
- [ ] Confounding, bias, and missing data are addressed; causal language matches the design.
- [ ] IRB/consent, ICMJE disclosures, and a data-availability statement are prepared.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Single-center descriptive series with limited generalizability and no clear management change.
- Pure animal/cell endocrine studies with no human translation or clinical relevance.
- Unvalidated or poorly described hormone assays underpinning the main claim.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Diabetes-only or single-trial work better placed in a dedicated diabetes or high-impact venue.

## Re-routing decision

- Diabetes-focused clinical/epidemiologic or basic study → `diabetologia`.
- High-impact diabetes/endocrine trial with broad reach → `the-lancet-diabetes-and-endocrinology`.
- Diabetic kidney disease centered on nephrology → `journal-of-the-american-society-of-nephrology` / `kidney-international`.
- Endocrine surgery (thyroid/adrenal/pituitary surgical outcomes) → `jama-surgery`.
- Broad practice-changing endocrine trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
