# R&R Revision & Response (commres-rebuttal)

A CR R&R is won by satisfying **two independent expert reviewers** at once (CR needs two reviews to
back a Revise/Accept), usually on **measurement validity, the tested mechanism, and confound control**
— and you must do it inside the **45-page (double-spaced, inclusive of references)** limit. This skill
is about that brokering and the page budget, not about inventing data.

## When to trigger

- A CR R&R arrived and you are scoping the revision before touching the manuscript
- Two reviewers want changes that partly conflict (e.g., more controls vs. a cleaner model)
- Required additions threaten to push the paper over the page limit
- You are writing the cover memo to the editor

## Step 1 — Map the two reviewers' demands before you write anything

For each reviewer, label what "convincing" means: stronger **measurement** (CFA, reliability,
discriminant validity), a tighter **mechanism** (better mediation identification, manipulated
mediator, bootstrap CIs), **confound/CMV** control, or **robustness**. CR's two-review rule means a
single enthusiastic reviewer cannot carry the paper — identify the **skeptical** reviewer and make
sure the revision answers them, not only the encouraging one. The editor's letter tells you which
demands are **load-bearing**.

## Step 2 — Decide each comment with the page budget in view

Every comment resolves to one of four moves; three cost pages:

| Move | When | Page-budget effect |
|------|------|--------------------|
| **Do in main text** | load-bearing; the editor flagged it | costs pages — find offsets |
| **Do in supplement** | adds rigor but not the core argument | frees main-text pages (scales/CFA/robustness) |
| **Reframe, don't add** | the concern is about framing/interpretation, not missing analysis | cheap; often the best move |
| **Decline, with a reason** | the request breaks the design or rests on a misreading | costs nothing; must be argued, not dodged |

When you add, **say what you cut or moved** to stay under 45 pages — reviewers trust a stated tradeoff
more than a paper that silently bloats. Most measurement and robustness detail belongs in the supplement.

## Step 3 — Answer the recurring CR demands on their own terms

| Typical CR R&R demand | Why it lands | The revision move |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Mediation is not convincing" | causal ordering or test is weak | manipulate/better-measure the mediator; report bootstrap CIs; hedge if cross-sectional |
| "Measurement validity unclear" | scale may not be the construct | add CFA, reliability, discriminant validity (supplement) |
| "Common-method variance" | same-survey predictor & outcome | add a CMV check; note procedural separation |
| "Alternative explanation X" | a rival is not ruled out | add the discriminating analysis or argue why the design already rules it out |
| "Effect size / interpretation missing" | stars without magnitude | report d/η²ₚ/β with CIs and substantive meaning |

When two reviewers pull opposite ways, state the tension, choose a principled path that keeps the model
coherent, and explain to the editor why it serves the contribution — do not quietly side with one.

## Step 4 — Keep the revision submittable

- **Double-anonymized integrity**: the revised main document **and supplements** stay de-identified;
  self-citations in the **third person**.
- **Transparency**: update the **data-availability statement** and any open-practice claims so new
  analyses, data, or materials are covered (see `commres-transparency-and-data`).
- **Format**: still **APA**, double-spaced, within 45 pages.

## Response memo structure (per reviewer, then a global note)

Lead with a short note to the editor: the 2–3 changes that matter most, and how you kept the paper
under the page limit. Then, per reviewer, a compact entry:

```
R# (focus: measurement / mechanism / confound / robustness)
• Comment → [paraphrase]
  Action: did-in-text / did-in-supplement / reframed / declined(reason)
  Where: §/p./Table/Fig./Supplement S#   |  Pages: +/- vs. prior draft
```

## Anti-patterns

- Satisfying the encouraging reviewer while ignoring the skeptical one (CR needs two on side)
- Treating a measurement or CMV demand as nitpicking instead of answering it with evidence
- Adding analyses until the paper busts the 45-page limit, with no statement of what moved
- Letting the data-availability statement / open-practice claims fall out of sync with new analyses
- Re-identifying the authors in the revised file or supplements (breaks double-anonymization)

## Output format

```
【Two-reviewer map】R1/R2 → focus + what "convincing" means to each (skeptical one flagged)
【Editor's load-bearing points】listed and solved first?
【Per-comment moves】in-text / supplement / reframe / decline — each with location
【Page budget】revised length ≤ 45 pp; what was cut or moved to supplement
【Conflicts】opposing demands brokered in the open, model kept coherent? [Y/N]
【Anonymity + DAS】third-person self-cites + transparency updated? [Y/N]
【Next】resubmit via SAGE Track
```
