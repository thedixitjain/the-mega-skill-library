# IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)

## Conference positioning

IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER) is a top computer-science conference venue for software analysis, reverse engineering, reengineering, evolution, and code intelligence. It rewards a software-analysis paper with practical tool evidence and clear reengineering value. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names SANER / IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering as the target venue.
- A manuscript in software analysis needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: software analysis, reverse engineering, reengineering, evolution, and code intelligence.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to SANER's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Treat SANER as a software analysis venue whose reviewers expect the scope and evidence to match its own community. Do not submit a generic CS paper until the introduction names the exact subcommunity, contribution type, and proof or empirical standard.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: software analysis, reverse engineering, reengineering, evolution, and code intelligence.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: software, analysis, reverse, engineering, reengineering, evolution, code, intelligence, venue-specific, contribution, conf, researchr.
- Official anchor domain: conf.researchr.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Route to SANER when the claim is about software analysis, reverse engineering, reengineering,
  or evolution: the paper should explain how existing systems are understood, transformed,
  migrated, repaired, or modernized.
- Do not treat SANER as generic ICSE/FSE. If the contribution is mainly testing, route to ISSTA;
  if it is maintenance practice over repository histories, compare ICSME; if it is broad SE
  theory or automation, compare ICSE/FSE/ASE.

## What distinguishes this venue from its closest siblings

- **What SANER is.** The IEEE conference on **Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering** — program analysis, comprehension, and refactoring.
- **vs ICSME.** ICSME is **Software Maintenance and Evolution**; the two overlap heavily — route by community/cycle, with SANER leaning analysis/reengineering and ICSME leaning maintenance practice.
- **vs ICSE/FSE/MSR.** ICSE/FSE are the SE flagships and MSR is mining-repositories; pick SANER for analysis/reengineering contributions.

## SANER-specific routing detail

- Prefer SANER when the paper studies software analysis, evolution, reverse engineering, reengineering, technical debt, migration, repository mining, or program comprehension.
- Route testing/fuzzing/bug-finding methods to ISSTA, maintenance-process work to ICSME, and broad automated tool work to ASE when automation is the main novelty.
- SANER evidence should expose software-history context, artifacts, analysis validity, evolution scenario, developer relevance, and threats to validity.

## Method & evidence bar

- Use real programs, benchmarks, proofs, developer studies, or artifacts matched to the contribution type.
- For tools, report usability, scalability, false positives/negatives, and reproducible artifact details.
- For theory, provide precise definitions and complete proofs; for empirical SE, foreground validity threats.
- For SANER, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: a software-analysis paper with practical tool evidence and clear reengineering value.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- State the software-engineering or language problem in terms of developer, program, proof, or runtime consequence.
- Keep examples small but nontrivial, then scale evidence to realistic code or formal benchmarks.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://conf.researchr.org/series/saner
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: OpenReview / CMT / HotCRP / PCS / START or society portal, as specified for the current cycle.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at SANER, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle software analysis papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Toy examples with no evidence on real programs or benchmarks.
- Tool paper without artifact clarity or comparison to current systems.
- Empirical claims without validity analysis or reproducible data pipeline.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving SANER reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses SANER's bar, compare against `international-conference-on-software-engineering` / `acm-international-conference-on-the-foundations-of-software-engineering` / `ieee-acm-international-conference-on-automated-software-engineering` / `acm-sigplan-conference-on-programming-language-design-and-implementation`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
