# Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (journal-of-the-american-society-of-nephrology)

## Journal positioning

The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN) is the American Society of
Nephrology flagship, publishing high-impact nephrology research across the full
evidence spectrum: clinical trials and cohorts in kidney disease, dialysis, and
transplantation; translational kidney biomarker and -omics work; and basic renal
physiology, cell biology, and disease-mechanism science. Its defining expectation is a
**mechanistically or clinically significant advance in kidney health and disease**,
with an emphasis on discovery and disease mechanism alongside rigorous clinical work —
not a small single-center series or a descriptive registry slice. With its U.S.
society base, JASN often anchors strongly in mechanism, novel biology, and trials that
move nephrology practice. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** aid;
it is not clinical or regulatory advice and does not replace the journal's current
instructions for authors. Before submitting, re-check the live JASN author instructions.

## When to trigger

- The author names JASN for a nephrology clinical, translational, or basic-science study
  and wants a fit/framing check.
- A kidney study must be re-framed around a disease mechanism or a practice-changing
  nephrology question rather than a descriptive report.
- The author is choosing between JASN and Kidney International (ISN flagship), or between
  JASN and general medicine.
- The author needs the journal's reporting-guideline, registration, and basic/animal-study
  expectations for kidney research.

## Scope & topic fit

- Chronic and acute kidney disease: CKD progression, AKI, glomerular and tubulointerstitial
  disease, and diabetic and hypertensive kidney disease.
- Dialysis and renal replacement: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and outcomes/access
  research.
- Kidney transplantation: immunology, rejection, allograft outcomes, and organ-preservation
  science.
- Renal physiology and cell biology: tubular transport, podocyte and glomerular biology,
  fibrosis, and electrolyte/acid-base mechanism.
- Translational nephrology: kidney biomarkers, genetics/genomics, single-cell and -omics
  atlases with disease relevance.
- Clinical trials and large cohorts with kidney endpoints (eGFR/kidney failure, mortality,
  cardiovascular outcomes in CKD).

## Method & evidence bar

- Clinical studies must be adequately powered with prespecified, patient-centered kidney
  endpoints; trials require prospective registration and the registration number.
- The applicable reporting guideline and checklist are expected: CONSORT for trials,
  STROBE for observational work, PRISMA for systematic reviews, ARRIVE for animal studies.
- Basic/translational work needs rigorous controls, biological replication, validated
  reagents/models, and blinded/randomized animal experiments where applicable.
- Mechanistic claims require perturbation evidence in cells or animals plus anchoring to
  human kidney tissue, biofluids, or cohorts where feasible.
- Effect estimates need confidence intervals and absolute as well as relative measures;
  causal language must match the design and model.
- eGFR/biomarker methods, kidney-outcome definitions, and statistical-analysis plans must
  be explicit.

## Structure & house style

- ASN format with a structured abstract and a significance/visual-abstract statement;
  re-check current article types (Original Article, Basic Research, Clinical Research, etc.)
  and limits on the live guide.
- The introduction frames the kidney-biology or clinical gap; the discussion states the
  mechanistic insight or practice implication and bounds overreach.
- A CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA flow diagram is expected for the relevant clinical design;
  animal work reports ARRIVE-aligned detail.
- Figures show representative data with statistics, N, and replication; a supplement
  carries full methods, the protocol/SAP, and additional experiments.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the ICMJE/EQUATOR and ASN anchors,
  then cite the current JASN page you checked.
- Search the live site for "JASN American Society of Nephrology instructions for authors"
  and follow the current version.
- Re-check article types, abstract and significance-statement format, and word/figure/reference limits.
- Confirm trial registration, the reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/ARRIVE),
  data/code-availability, and protocol/SAP submission.
- Re-check IRB/ethics and consent, transplant-donor consent where relevant, animal-care/IACUC
  approval, ICMJE authorship and conflict-of-interest disclosure, funding, and AI-use disclosure.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The study delivers a clear kidney-disease mechanism or a practice-changing nephrology finding.
- [ ] Clinical kidney endpoints are prespecified and powered; trials are registered with the number in the manuscript.
- [ ] The correct reporting checklist (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/ARRIVE) is completed and attached.
- [ ] Basic/translational work shows controls, replication, model validation, and human anchoring.
- [ ] Mechanistic claims rest on perturbation evidence, not association alone.
- [ ] IRB/consent, IACUC (if animal), ICMJE disclosures, and a data-availability statement are prepared.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Single-center descriptive series or registry slice with no mechanism and no practice change.
- Association-only biomarker/-omics studies with no validation cohort or functional follow-up.
- Animal/cell kidney work without human relevance, replication, or ARRIVE-aligned rigor.
- Missing trial registration, protocol, or the required reporting checklist.
- Incremental dialysis/transplant outcome reports with limited generalizability or novelty.

## Re-routing decision

- Global-perspective or epidemiology-heavy nephrology with less mechanistic depth → `kidney-international`.
- Diabetic kidney disease framed primarily around endocrine/metabolic mechanism → `diabetologia` / `journal-of-clinical-endocrinology-and-metabolism`.
- Critical-care AKI dominated by ICU organ-support → `critical-care-medicine` / `american-journal-of-respiratory-and-critical-care-medicine`.
- Broad practice-changing nephrology trial → general medicine (`jama` / NEJM / The Lancet in the natural-science bundle).
- Pure renal cell biology with no disease anchor → a basic-science venue in the natural-science bundle.
