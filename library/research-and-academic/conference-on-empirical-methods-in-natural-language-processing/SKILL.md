# Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)

## Conference positioning

Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) is a top computer-science conference venue for empirical NLP, language model evaluation, generation, information extraction, multilingual NLP, and applied language systems. It rewards an empirically strong NLP paper with robust baselines, error analysis, and transparent evaluation. Treat this skill as a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool for conference submission strategy, not as a substitute for the current year's CFP, author kit, ethics policy, or submission portal.

Because CS conferences change deadlines, templates, page limits, review workflow, artifact rules, AI-use policy, and rebuttal formats every cycle, always verify the live official instructions before making a submission-ready recommendation. Start from the official source anchor recorded for this venue in `../../resources/conference-roster.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`.

## When to trigger

- The author names EMNLP / Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing as the target venue.
- A manuscript in empirical NLP needs a conference-fit read before being formatted or submitted.
- The paper must be re-framed from journal style or arXiv style into a selective CS conference narrative.
- The author needs an evidence-gap, anonymity, artifact, rebuttal, or re-routing diagnosis for this venue.

## Scope & topic fit

- Core fit: empirical NLP, language model evaluation, generation, information extraction, multilingual NLP, and applied language systems.
- Best submissions make a precise contribution type visible: algorithm, theorem, system, dataset, benchmark, empirical finding, design artifact, tool, or socio-technical analysis.
- The paper should explain why the result matters to EMNLP's reviewers, not just why it is interesting to the authors' lab or product context.
- Position related work against the most recent conference-cycle papers in this venue and its closest siblings; stale comparisons are a common early-review weakness.
- If the contribution is interdisciplinary, state which part is CS research and which part is domain evidence.

## Venue-specific calibration

- Reviewer lens: Read reviewers as ACL-family specialists. Task formulation, language coverage, evaluation validity, and error analysis must be explicit.
- Contribution hook to foreground: the venue-specific contribution bar.
- Scope vocabulary to use naturally in the abstract and introduction: empirical NLP, language model evaluation, generation, information extraction, multilingual NLP, and applied language systems.
- Distinctive fingerprint for reviewer calibration: empirical, language, model, evaluation, generation, information, extraction, multilingual, applied, venue-specific, contribution, flagship, emnlp.
- Official anchor domain: 2026.emnlp.org. Quote annual rules only after opening that source and the current-year CFP/author kit.

## Close-neighbor routing guardrail

- Use this profile only when the manuscript's central contribution is genuinely in NLP flagship
  and the author can say why EMNLP reviewers are the primary audience, not merely a convenient
  deadline.
- Closest roster neighbors to compare before final routing: `annual-meeting-of-the-association-
  for-computational-linguistics` (ACL), `north-american-chapter-of-the-association-for-
  computational-linguistics` (NAACL), `european-chapter-of-the-association-for-computational-
  linguistics` (EACL). Break ties by contribution type, evidence shape, reviewer community,
  and the current official CFP from 2026.emnlp.org.

## EMNLP-specific routing detail

- Prefer EMNLP when the paper is empirical NLP with strong modeling, experiments, datasets, evaluation, or analysis for language processing tasks.
- Route natural-language learning theory or structured learning focus to CoNLL, resources/evaluation to LREC-COLING, and generation-specific work to INLG when those communities are primary.
- EMNLP evidence should include baselines, data documentation, evaluation design, robustness/error analysis, language coverage, and limits of model behavior.

## Method & evidence bar

- Use task-appropriate baselines, multiple datasets or languages when the claim is broad, and error analysis that explains model behavior.
- For LLM work, control for data leakage, prompt sensitivity, evaluation contamination, and human-evaluation reliability.
- For resources, document annotation, licensing, demographics, quality control, and intended use.
- For EMNLP, the evidence must support the venue-specific signature: an empirically strong NLP paper with robust baselines, error analysis, and transparent evaluation.
- Include limitations, negative results, compute/resource reporting, data provenance, and ethics details when they affect the claim.

## Structure & house style

- State the language phenomenon, task, or system behavior before the model name.
- Connect examples to measured errors; reviewers dislike anecdotal examples presented as evidence.
- Use the current official template exactly; do not guess page limits, font sizes, supplement rules, anonymity exceptions, or camera-ready requirements from old cycles.
- The introduction should answer: problem, why now, what is new, why this venue, and what evidence proves the claim.
- Put the strongest result in the main paper, not only in the appendix or supplement; reviewers should not have to reconstruct the contribution.

## Official-cycle checklist

- Open the live official venue page: https://2026.emnlp.org/
- Re-check the current cycle's CFP, author kit, submission system, abstract/paper deadlines, page limits, supplementary-material rules, anonymity policy, dual-submission policy, ethics policy, AI-use policy, artifact/code/data expectations, rebuttal/author-response format, and camera-ready requirements.
- Confirm the review workflow and portal: ARR/START/ACL Rolling Review or the current ACL-family submission portal, plus ACLPUB formatting when applicable.
- Check whether accepted papers require in-person presentation, separate registration, artifact badges, proceedings copyright, or post-acceptance release forms.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence states why this manuscript belongs at EMNLP, using the venue's scope rather than generic "top conference" language.
- [ ] The claim is calibrated to the evidence: no broader than the datasets, proofs, systems, user studies, deployments, or threat model support.
- [ ] Related work includes the nearest current-cycle NLP flagship papers and explains the technical delta.
- [ ] The paper satisfies the current official template, anonymity, ethics, artifact, and rebuttal requirements.
- [ ] The main paper is self-contained enough for reviewers to evaluate novelty and correctness without hunting through external links.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Evaluation that is only a prompt table or cherry-picked generation examples.
- Missing dataset documentation, licensing, or annotation reliability.
- Claims of general language understanding from narrow English-only benchmarks.
- Formatting, anonymity, dual-submission, external-link, or supplement violations under the current-year policy.
- A contribution framed for a neighboring field while giving EMNLP reviewers too little technical or empirical substance.

## Re-routing decision

If the paper misses EMNLP's bar, compare against `annual-meeting-of-the-association-for-computational-linguistics` / `north-american-chapter-of-the-association-for-computational-linguistics` / `european-chapter-of-the-association-for-computational-linguistics` / `interspeech`. Re-route based on contribution type, not prestige: theory to a theory venue, systems to a systems venue, application-heavy work to a domain venue, and early ideas to workshops or shorter tracks when the official CFP supports them.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
[Contribution type] algorithm / theory / system / dataset / benchmark / empirical / design / security / other
[Main evidence gap] <single most important missing proof, experiment, study, artifact, or policy check>
[Official items to re-check] CFP / author kit / deadline / format / anonymity / ethics / AI-use / artifact / rebuttal / camera-ready
[Top rejection risk] <venue-specific risk>
[Re-route suggestion] <better-matched conference or journal if not a fit>
