AJPS rewards testable theory tightly linked to the empirical strategy, with hypotheses stated before the results. Structures the argument; it does not run analyses."

# Theory & Argument Building (ajps-theory-building)

At AJPS the theory exists to **generate testable expectations** that the design and data then
adjudicate. The journal's empirical bar means a model or argument earns its place only if it yields
**observable, falsifiable implications** that the analysis can confront. This skill turns an idea into
hypotheses, mechanisms, and scope conditions in the idiom your work demands.

## When to trigger

- The empirics are strong but the "why" / mechanism is thin
- A reviewer said the paper is "atheoretical," "ad hoc," or "a model with no test"
- You need to state mechanisms, assumptions, and scope conditions explicitly
- Formal modeling: deciding what to model, what to assume, and what the model buys

## Build the argument (by mode of work)

### Empirical paper with a theory
1. **Concept** — define key constructs precisely; distinguish from neighbors and from how they will be
   measured (hand off to `ajps-data-analysis` for validation).
2. **Mechanism** — the causal story: who acts, why, under what incentives/constraints.
3. **Hypotheses** — state the **directional, testable** expectations *before* the results, and what
   pattern would **disconfirm** them. These become the tests in `ajps-research-design`.
4. **Scope conditions** — where the argument holds and where it does not.

### Formal / game-theoretic paper
- State the **substantive puzzle** the model addresses before the setup.
- Keep assumptions **transparent and motivated**; flag which results depend on which assumptions.
- Translate equilibrium predictions into **comparative statics** a reader can test or recognize.
- Make the empirical test follow from the model, and distinguish predictions **unique** to your model
  from those shared with rivals.

### Measurement / methodology paper (Research Note territory)
- Define the quantity the new measure/method recovers and the bias in existing approaches.
- State the conditions under which it outperforms incumbents, with a validation plan.

## The "testability" gate (AJPS-specific)

Before proceeding, write the sentence: *"If the theory is right, we should observe ___; if a rival is
right, we should observe ___ instead."* If you cannot fill both blanks with something the data can
distinguish, the theory is not yet ready for an AJPS empirical confrontation.

## Anti-patterns

- HARKing — fitting hypotheses to results after the fact; state theory before tests, preregister where possible
- A model whose assumptions are reverse-engineered to deliver the desired prediction
- Mechanisms named but never made observable or testable
- Universal claims with no scope conditions
- Burying the argument under the empirics — the contribution must be stated plainly up front


## Operating pass for American Journal of Political Science

Run this as a concrete capability pass. First lock the political theory, design leverage, measurement validity, and scope condition; then test whether the manuscript addresses political-science reviewers who expect tight theory, transparent design, and a contribution that travels across political settings.

- **Primary move:** Return a claim-evidence-risk ledger; every recommendation must point to a manuscript location or missing artifact.
- **Decision ledger:** return `claim / evidence / blocker / next edit` rows so the next pass can patch the manuscript directly.
- **Sibling comparison:** compare against APSR for field-wide breadth, Journal of Politics for broader political-science audience, Political Analysis for methods-first work; if the neighboring outlet has the stronger audience claim, recommend re-routing before polishing.
- **Verification floor:** before submission-ready advice, re-open `resources/official-source-map.md` for volatile rules and name the one unresolved fact that could change the recommendation.

## Output format

```
【Core claim】one sentence
【Mechanism】the causal/logical story
【Hypotheses】directional, stated before results
【Assumptions】(formal) the load-bearing ones
【Disconfirming pattern】what would falsify it
【Scope conditions】where it holds / fails
【Next】ajps-research-design
```
