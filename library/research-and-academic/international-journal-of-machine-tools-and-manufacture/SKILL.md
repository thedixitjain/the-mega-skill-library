# International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture (international-journal-of-machine-tools-and-manufacture)

## Journal positioning

The International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture (IJMTM) is a leading
archival journal for **precision and advanced manufacturing science**: the mechanics
of machining and forming processes, machine-tool dynamics, precision metrology,
surface integrity, and novel manufacturing processes. Its center of gravity is
manufacturing science — a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of why a process
behaves as it does and how it governs accuracy, surface quality, or productivity —
established through rigorous experiment combined with modeling. Papers that report a
parameter optimization for one workpiece with no transferable manufacturing insight,
or a measurement with no process understanding, are a weak fit. This skill is a
**fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool. It does not replace the journal's
current official author guidelines. Before submitting, re-check the live IJMTM Guide
for Authors.

## When to trigger

- The author names IJMTM for a machining, forming, metrology, or machine-tool
  manuscript and wants a fit/framing check.
- A manufacturing paper must be re-framed from "we optimized parameters for this part"
  into a process-mechanics or machine-tool-science contribution.
- The author is choosing between IJMTM (subtractive/precision, process mechanics) and
  an additive-manufacturing or materials venue.
- The author needs IJMTM's manufacturing-science rigor bar and desk-reject heuristics.

## Scope & topic fit

- Machining process mechanics: cutting force/temperature/chip-formation modeling,
  tool wear, high-speed/precision/micro-machining, and machinability of advanced materials.
- Forming process mechanics: metal forming, incremental and sheet/bulk forming,
  springback and formability with a process-science contribution.
- Machine-tool dynamics and structures: chatter and stability, spindle/feed-drive
  dynamics, thermal errors, vibration, and control of machine behavior.
- Precision metrology and inspection: on-machine and in-process measurement, error
  modeling and compensation, dimensional and geometric accuracy.
- Surface integrity and functional surfaces: residual stress, surface texture, and the
  process-to-surface-property link.
- Novel and hybrid manufacturing processes (e.g., laser-assisted, ultrasonic-assisted,
  micro/nano fabrication) when the manufacturing mechanism is the advance.

## Method & evidence bar

- The central claim is a **mechanistic understanding of a manufacturing process or
  machine-tool behavior** — predictive of accuracy, surface, stability, or
  productivity — not a one-off best-parameter table.
- Experiments must be controlled and quantitative: report process conditions,
  instrumentation, measurement uncertainty, and repeatability.
- Models (analytical, FE, dynamic) must be validated against experiment and used to
  explain the process, not merely curve-fit a single dataset.
- Metrology and accuracy claims require traceability and stated measurement capability,
  not nominal manufacturer specs.
- Benchmark against the correct baseline process/condition and against state-of-the-art
  manufacturing methods, not a strawman.
- Reproducibility: report machine, tooling, material, process windows, and measurement
  protocol in enough detail to reproduce the process behavior.

## Structure & house style

- Standard full-length research-article structure; IJMTM publishes archival articles —
  re-check article types on the live guide.
- The introduction motivates the manufacturing-science gap (process mechanism, accuracy,
  stability), not a single application; the discussion makes the process–performance
  argument explicit.
- Equations and models are supported by validation; notation and units follow
  manufacturing-engineering conventions.
- Figures are load-bearing: force/stability diagrams, surface and metrology data with
  uncertainty, model-vs-experiment overlays, and process schematics.
- Supplementary material carries extended process data and measurement details; the
  main-text figures must support the central manufacturing insight on their own.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the Elsevier anchors, then
  cite the current IJMTM Guide for Authors page you checked.
- Search the live site for "International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture guide
  for authors" and follow the current Elsevier/Editorial Manager version.
- Re-check article types, length/figure expectations, and the data-availability policy
  for process/measurement data.
- Confirm highlights, graphical-abstract, and any structured-abstract requirement.
- Re-check competing-interests, funding, author-contribution (CRediT), and AI-use
  disclosure requirements.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official
  instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The contribution is a manufacturing-process or machine-tool mechanism, not a parameter optimization for one part.
- [ ] Experiments report conditions, instrumentation, measurement uncertainty, and repeatability.
- [ ] Models are validated against experiment and used to explain the process, not just fitted to one dataset.
- [ ] Metrology/accuracy claims are traceable with stated measurement capability.
- [ ] Results are benchmarked against the correct baseline process and state-of-the-art methods.
- [ ] The article type and length fit IJMTM's archival format.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Parameter/Taguchi optimization for a single workpiece with no transferable process science.
- Measurement or characterization report with no process mechanism or machine-tool understanding.
- Models presented without experimental validation or used only to curve-fit one dataset.
- Accuracy/surface claims without measurement uncertainty or traceability.
- Scope mismatch: a pure materials, additive-process, or control-theory paper with manufacturing as a label.
- Better framed as an additive-manufacturing study or a materials/structures application.

## Re-routing decision

- Additive-manufacturing process or process–structure–property focus → `additive-manufacturing`.
- Microstructure-first materials mechanism of the machined/formed material → `acta-materialia`.
- Forming mechanics where the constitutive/plasticity model is the core → `international-journal-of-plasticity`.
- Composite-material machining/manufacturing where composites are the focus → `composites-part-b-engineering`.
- Machine-tool control theorems with guarantees rather than process science → `ieee-transactions-on-automatic-control`.
