# ICDM Topic Selection

Use this before writing. Two decisions happen here: is the work **ICDM-shaped at all**,
and if so, **which track**. ICDM is the IEEE-sponsored data-mining flagship; it rewards a
named data-mining mechanism on a defined mining task with strong baselines and a
scalability or discovery-validity story — not pure learning theory, and not a broad
deep-learning systems result.

## Fit test

- Prefer ICDM when the contribution is a **data-mining method**: pattern discovery, graph
  mining, anomaly detection, temporal/streaming mining, clustering, or scalable analytics,
  with an algorithmic idea and defensible empirical evidence.
- Route to **SDM (SIAM)** if the contribution is primarily mathematical/statistical rigor
  in a mining method — SDM's community weights theory and analysis more heavily.
- Route to **KDD** if the work is large-scale applied discovery or a deployed data-science
  system aimed at the biggest data-mining audience and its two-cycle calendar.
- Route to **CIKM** for information/knowledge management, IR, and database-adjacent work;
  to **WSDM** for web-and-social search and mining; to **WWW/TheWebConf** for web-native
  contributions; to **ICDE/SIGMOD/VLDB** for database-systems results.
- Route to an **ML flagship** (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR) if the contribution is a general learning
  method with thin data-mining specificity.

## Track fork within ICDM

| Track | 2026 review | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Research | Triple-blind | A novel mining algorithm/mechanism with baselines and scale evidence |
| Applied | Single-blind (new in 2026) | A deployed/industrial system with measured real-world impact |
| Blue Sky | CCC-sponsored | A visionary, forward-looking position with a research agenda |

If a project is a deployed system whose contribution is the deployment and its measured
outcomes, the Applied Track fits and spares you the triple-blind anonymization burden. If
the contribution is the algorithm and the deployment is illustrative, stay on Research.

## Fit signal table

| Signal in the project | ICDM reading |
|---|---|
| Named mining mechanism + baselines + scaling curve | Core fit — the house genre |
| Anomaly/graph/pattern/stream mining with a discovery-validity argument | Core fit |
| Deployed system with quantified impact, deployment is the point | Applied Track |
| Pure statistical/theoretical mining analysis | Better served at SDM |
| Broad deep-learning method, little mining specificity | Route to an ML flagship |
| Database-systems or query contribution | Route to ICDE/SIGMOD/VLDB |

## The routing calendar from ICDM's seat

ICDM's deadline sits in **June**, conference in **November**. That position matters when
choosing where a finished project goes next: a paper not ready for ICDM's June can often
target CIKM (spring deadline, autumn conference) the same year, WSDM (late-summer deadline,
following spring), SDM (autumn deadline, following spring), or KDD's next cycle. Choose by
community and format fit, not prestige — the same result reads differently to each pool.

## Vignette: where a streaming anomaly detector goes

A project delivers a one-pass anomaly detector for edge streams with a memory bound and
experiments on injected anomalies. ICDM reading: strong Research Track fit — a named
mining mechanism, a scaling argument, and a discovery-validity claim. Strip the mechanism
and keep only "we deployed it and fraud dropped," and it becomes an Applied Track paper
(or a KDD applied submission). Grow it into a pure asymptotic analysis of the sketch with
no system, and SDM becomes the better community.

## Sharpening moves before committing

- Name the mining task and the data regime in one sentence; if you cannot, the ICDM
  framing does not exist yet.
- Name the single mechanism the contribution rests on, and the baseline it beats *for a
  stated reason*, not just on a leaderboard.
- Confirm the whole argument — body, references, appendix — can fit ICDM's 10-page
  all-inclusive cap; a result needing 14 pages is a journal or SDM paper.
- Topic emphasis and track lineup drift between editions; scan the current calls before
  final routing.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] strong ICDM / possible ICDM / better elsewhere
[Track] Research / Applied / Blue Sky
[Best venue] ICDM / KDD / SDM / CIKM / WSDM / WWW / ICDE / ML-flagship / journal
[Contribution sentence] <one sentence naming task + mechanism>
[Top rejection risk] <novelty / baselines / scale / discovery-validity / fit>
[Next action] <experiment, framing, track switch, or venue switch>
```
