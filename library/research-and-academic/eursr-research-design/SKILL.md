# Research Design (eursr-research-design)

ESR is a quantitative journal exacting about whether the **comparative or longitudinal design actually
identifies the mechanism** from `eursr-theory-building` and rules out the leading confound. The design
must connect the cross-level hypothesis to evidence that a single cross-section could not provide.

## When to trigger

- Specifying the comparative frame, the panel structure, sampling, or the identification strategy
- A reviewer questioned causal claims, generalization, selection, measurement comparability, or a confound
- Justifying why your design adjudicates the rival account from `eursr-literature-positioning`

## Comparative / cross-national
- **Justify the country set** by design logic (institutional contrast, regime types, most/least-similar),
  not by data availability alone; say what variation each context contributes.
- **Measurement equivalence** is the first reviewer demand: establish that constructs mean the same
  across countries (configural/metric/scalar invariance for latent scales; harmonized coding for
  education via ISCED/CASMIN, occupation via ISCO/ISEI/EGP).
- **Macro N is small.** With ~20-30 countries, country-level effects rest on few degrees of freedom —
  design the macro hypothesis so it does not over-claim from a handful of clusters (see
  `eursr-data-analysis`).

## Panel / longitudinal / event-history
- **State what the panel buys.** Within-person change (fixed effects), duration/timing (event history),
  or growth (latent growth) — match the estimator to the theoretical quantity.
- **Attrition and selection** into and out of the panel must be addressed (weights, IPW, sensitivity).
- For staggered policy exposure, use **heterogeneity-robust DiD** (Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham,
  Borusyak et al.), not naive TWFE.

## Causal inference where feasible
- Much of ESR is observational; **distinguish description, association, and causation honestly**. If
  causal, state the assumptions (ignorability, parallel trends, exclusion) and defend them; report a
  **sensitivity bound** (how strong an unobserved confounder would have to be).

## Multilevel / SEM
- Specify the level structure (individuals in countries/regions/cohorts), the random effects, and why a
  multilevel model is warranted; for measurement, build the latent model before the structural one.

## The adjudication test (ESR-specific)

For the **single strongest rival explanation**: *"If the rival were true rather than my argument, the
cross-national (or over-time) pattern would look like ___; instead it looks like ___."* If you cannot
write it, the comparative/panel design does not yet identify the contribution.

## What ESR referees demand of each design

| Design | Referee's first demand | Satisfying move |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| Comparative cross-national | "Are the measures equivalent?" | invariance / harmonized coding; justified country set |
| Panel / fixed-effects | "What does within-person change identify?" | match estimator to the quantity; handle attrition |
| Event history | "Right risk set and time scale?" | defined onset, censoring, time-varying covariates |
| Causal (DiD/IV/RDD) | "Assumption defended?" | state + test the assumption; sensitivity bound |
| Multilevel / SEM | "Enough clusters; measurement first?" | macro df honesty; fit the latent model before structure |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A comparative study argues that vocational specificity smooths the school-to-work transition.

```
Country set: most-different welfare/training regimes (e.g., dual-system vs. general-education systems),
  chosen for institutional contrast, not convenience
Measurement: education harmonized via ISCED; vocational specificity coded from program-level data
Design: cross-national + cohort variation; cross-level interaction (specificity × individual track)
Disconfirming pattern sought: if signaling (not skills) drove it, the advantage would vanish once firms
  learn quality → instead it persists across the early career, as the specificity argument predicts
Macro-N caution: ~24 countries → country-level claim kept modest; SEs / df handled in data-analysis
```

The country set is design-driven, the measures are comparable, and the design specifies what pattern would falsify the argument.

## Referee pushback → ESR-specific fix

- *"Measures aren't comparable across countries."* → Test invariance; report partial invariance and
  what it permits; use harmonized coding schemes.
- *"You infer too much from ~20 countries."* → Re-state the macro claim modestly; use df-appropriate
  inference (see `eursr-data-analysis`).
- *"Association dressed as causation."* → Restate what the design identifies; add a sensitivity bound or
  placebo; drop causal verbs you cannot defend.

## Calibration anchors

- **Measurement equivalence is the comparative gate.** A cross-national claim built on non-equivalent
  scales is the most common fatal design flaw at ESR.
- **The adjudication sentence is the test.** If you can't write "if the rival were true the pattern
  would look like ___," the comparison/panel does not yet earn the contribution.
- **Identification honesty travels.** Stating plainly what observational European data can and cannot
  establish reads as strength to a quantitative panel.

## Execution bridge (StatsPAI / Stata MCP)

Estimate and audit the design, don't only describe it. Full map:
[`execution-with-mcp`](../../../shared-resources/empirical-methods/execution-with-mcp.md). ESR is comparative quantitative sociology; cross-country panels with confounded institutions — foreground fixed effects and clustering.

- `detect_design` → `recommend` → fit with `as_handle=true` → `audit_result`.
- **Observational causal claims:** staggered DiD (`callaway_santanna` / `sun_abraham` +
  `bacon_decomposition` + `honest_did_from_result`); IV (`effective_f_test` +
  `anderson_rubin_ci`); RDD (`rdrobust` + `mccrary_test`).
- **Experiments:** randomization-based inference, `romano_wolf` for many-outcome
  family-wise control, and `mediate` for mediation (not naive controlling-away).
- **Sensitivity:** `oster_delta` / `sensemakr` for observational claims.

Report the effect size in interpretable units; route the full battery to the
appendix/supplement. A run end-to-end (synthetic data, real returns) is in the
[JF execution walkthrough](../../../Journal-of-Finance-Skills/resources/worked-examples/02-execution-walkthrough.md).
## Anti-patterns

- A country set chosen by data availability and dressed up as theory-driven
- Cross-national latent comparisons with no measurement-invariance check
- Over-claiming country-level effects from a handful of clusters
- Naive TWFE on staggered policy timing; ignoring panel attrition
- A design that cannot distinguish your mechanism from the leading alternative

## Output format

```
【Design】comparative / panel / event-history / causal / multilevel-SEM
【What it identifies】description / association / causation
【Comparability / assumption】invariance or key assumption + how defended
【Rival ruled out】the adjudication sentence
【Macro-N / attrition / sensitivity】planned
【Next】eursr-data-analysis
```
