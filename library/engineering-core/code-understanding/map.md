# [MAP] Application Context Mapping

Build a ground-truth model of the target codebase before attacking it. The goal is to understand the application's trust model, where input enters, where decisions get made, and where dangerous operations occur.

## Input

A target directory or repository.

## Purpose

A context map answers: *"If I were the attacker, what would I care about here?"*

This is not documentation generation. It is adversarial reconnaissance at the source level.

## Task

**[MAP-0] Source Inventory**

Before any manual enumeration, build the source inventory (the understand command's Step 1 already did this — `$WORKDIR/checklist.json` should exist).

Read the resulting `checklist.json`. It provides every source file with language, line count, SHA-256 checksum, and every function with name, line number, and signature. Excluded files are recorded with reasons.

If tree-sitter is installed, functions also include a `metadata` field with:
- `attributes` — decorators (Python) and annotations (Java) that identify entry points and auth gates
- `visibility` — public/private/static/exported/extern
- `class_name` — enclosing class or receiver type
- `return_type` and `parameters` — typed signatures for data flow analysis

Check the metadata BEFORE reading code — it may already answer questions about entry points, trust boundaries, and attack surface without needing to open files.

Use this as your ground truth for what exists in the codebase. Do NOT manually enumerate files.

**[MAP-1] Entry Point Enumeration**

Find all locations where external input enters the application:
- HTTP routes (GET/POST handlers, REST endpoints, GraphQL resolvers)
- CLI argument parsers
- File/socket readers
- Message queue consumers
- Deserialization entry points (JSON parsers, pickle loads, XML parsers)
- IPC handlers

For each: record file path, line number, and what data it accepts.

For each source, also assign a **`trust_level`** — the provenance of the data it introduces, i.e. how attacker-controllable it is *at the point it enters*:

- `attacker_controlled` — the attacker supplies it directly: HTTP body/query/headers/cookies, `argv`/stdin, `recv`/socket reads, uploaded file contents, webhook payloads before signature verification.
- `persistent_store` — read from storage that may hold attacker data written in an earlier request: DB rows, cache, message queues, files written by another actor. Cross-class flow out of here is the "stored" vuln family (stored XSS / stored cmd-injection) — note it for Stage B.
- `internal_value` — server-generated, not attacker-influenced: UUIDs / sequence IDs the server mints, JWT claims *after* signature verification, values checked against a closed allow-list.
- `runtime_constant` — fixed before any request: compile-time constants, hardcoded config, env vars loaded at startup.

When a value combines inputs, take the most-attacker-controlled (`attacker_controlled` > `persistent_store` > `internal_value` > `runtime_constant`). These labels correspond to L1-L4 respectively for anyone coming from that vocabulary.

**[MAP-2] Trust Boundary Identification**

Identify where the code makes (or should make) trust decisions:
- Authentication checks (where credentials are verified)
- Authorization checks (where permissions are enforced)
- Input validation (where sanitization occurs)
- Privilege transitions (setuid, sudo, elevated operations)

Flag any entry point that reaches a sensitive operation *without* passing through a trust boundary.

**[MAP-3] Sink Catalog**

Find all dangerous operations:
- Database queries (especially raw/string-concatenated)
- Shell execution (`subprocess`, `exec`, `system`, `popen`)
- File system writes and reads (especially with user-controlled paths)
- Deserialization (`pickle.loads`, `eval`, `yaml.load` without SafeLoader)
- Network requests with user-controlled URLs (SSRF candidates)
- Template rendering with user data
- Cryptographic operations (especially key material handling)
- LDAP injection (`DirContext.search`, `LdapContext` with string-concatenated filters)
- JNDI lookup (`InitialContext.lookup`, `Context.lookup` with user-controlled names)
- XXE (`DocumentBuilderFactory`, `SAXParserFactory`, `XMLInputFactory` without disabling external entities)

For each: record file path, line number, and what data reaches it.

**[MAP-4] Architecture Summary**

Produce a brief summary covering:
- Application type (web app, CLI, daemon, library, etc.)
- Primary language(s) and frameworks
- Authentication model (session-based, token-based, API key, none)
- Database(s) and ORM (if any)
- External service dependencies
- Notable security controls present (WAF hints in code, CSP headers, rate limiting)

## Output Format

`context-map.json` is a superset of `attack-surface.json`. The top-level `sources`, `sinks`, and `trust_boundaries` keys use the same required fields as Stage B's `attack-surface.json` — so `cp context-map.json attack-surface.json` works. Context-map-specific fields (`meta`, `entry_points`, `unchecked_flows`) sit alongside as extra keys.

```json

For memory-corruption / arithmetic / bounds sinks (CWE-119/120/121/122/125/787/190/191/476), optionally include SMT-checkable path conditions on the sink_detail. The bridge propagates them into attack-paths.json so /validate Stage B's SMT pre-flight ([B-3.1.5]) doesn't have to re-extract from source. Skip for sinks where SMT doesn't apply (XSS/SQLi/cmdi etc — Z3 can't reason about strings the way string-sanitizer-bypass needs):

```json

  "sink_details": [

## Gates

GATES APPLY: U1 [READ-FIRST], U2 [ATTACKER-LENS], U5 [EVIDENCE-ONLY]

Do not populate `sources`, `sinks`, or `entry_points` from file names or common patterns alone — read the code and verify.

**[MAP-5] Normalise context-map**

Right after writing `context-map.json`, run the normaliser. It uses the
checklist in the same dir as ground truth to:
- backfill missing `name` fields on entry_points / sink_details from line ranges
- normalise file paths (strip leading `./`, convert absolute paths under
  the target into relative ones)
- warn (non-fatal) on hallucinated files / out-of-range line numbers /
  cross-reference typos in `unchecked_flows`

```bash
libexec/raptor-normalize-context-map "$WORKDIR"
```

Idempotent — safe to re-run. Skip this step only if `$WORKDIR/checklist.json`
doesn't exist (e.g. you skipped MAP-0 inventory build).

When you can, include the function `name` directly on each entry_point and
sink_detail you emit — it helps the normaliser skip backfill and is
clearer for human reviewers.

**[MAP-5b] Enrich entry points with forward-reachable closures**

After normalisation, run the call-graph enricher. Uses the inventory to
attach a `forward_reachable` field to each entry point, listing the
internal functions and external dep calls transitively reachable from
the entry's host function.

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-callgraph "$WORKDIR"
```

The enriched context-map.json carries machine-derived "this entry
reaches N internal + M external" data alongside the LLM's narrative —
useful for `/diagram` rendering and downstream consumers (audit
prioritisation, validate Stage F). Idempotent. Skip if
`$WORKDIR/checklist.json` doesn't exist or doesn't carry `target_path`.

**[MAP-5c] Enrich entry points and sinks with per-function AST views**

After normalisation, run the AST-view enricher. Uses the inventory to
attach an `ast_view` field to each entry point and sink whose
`(file, line)` resolves to an enclosing function: signature, calls
made inside the body, explicit returns, inline-asm flag.

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-ast-view "$WORKDIR"
```

The enriched context-map.json carries machine-derived structure (what
the function *is*) alongside the LLM's narrative (what the function
*does*). Downstream consumers — `/audit` Phase A per-function review,
`/validate` Stage B path enumeration, `/diagram` rendering — can read
this without re-parsing source. Idempotent. Skip if
`$WORKDIR/checklist.json` doesn't exist or doesn't carry `target_path`.

**[MAP-5d] Enrich with ownership / privilege / shared-state / crypto sites (C/C++)**

After normalisation, run the site enricher. Uses `source_intel` (cocci) to
attach four Phase B sections, each entry carrying `kind`, `file`, `line`,
and `function`:

* `ownership_model` — alloc / checked-alloc / paired-free / double-free sites
  (extras: `allocator`, `free_fn`, `role`)
* `privilege_model` — capability-check / LSM-hook sites
  (extras: `name`, `grade`)
* `shared_state` — lock acquire/release sites covering kernel spinlock /
  mutex / rwlock and POSIX `pthread_mutex` (kernel: variants `_irq`,
  `_irqsave`, `_bh`, `_interruptible`, `_killable`, `_trylock`; rw: read /
  write variants). Entry `kind` is the compound `<lock_kind>_<op>`
  (e.g. `spin_acquire`, `mutex_release`); extras: `fn` (concrete function
  matched, e.g. `spin_lock_irqsave`), `lock_var` (first-arg expression,
  whitespace-normalised). Atomics, RCU, and C++ scope-based locks
  (`std::lock_guard`) are intentionally out of scope here — each has
  semantics worth its own evidence shape and is deferred.
* `crypto_inventory` — cryptographic primitive calls + RNG sources. Entry
  `kind` is the call kind (`primitive_call` or `rng_source`); extras:
  `api` (`openssl` / `kernel` / `libsodium` / `libc`) and `fn` (concrete
  function matched, e.g. `EVP_EncryptInit_ex`). Covers OpenSSL modern EVP
  + legacy primitives (AES_/SHA_/HMAC_/DES_/RC4_/MD5_/BF_), Linux kernel
  crypto API (`crypto_alloc_*`, `crypto_skcipher_*`, `crypto_shash_*`,
  `crypto_ahash_*`, `crypto_aead_*`), libsodium (`crypto_secretbox_*`,
  `crypto_box_*`, `crypto_sign_*`, `crypto_aead_*`, `crypto_pwhash_*`),
  and RNG sources (`RAND_bytes`, `randombytes_buf`, `getrandom`,
  `get_random_bytes`, libc `rand`/`random`). MbedTLS, Windows BCrypt,
  Bouncy Castle / Java crypto, and C++ wrappers (Botan, Crypto++) are
  intentionally out of scope here — add as separate rules when target
  corpus shows demand. **Soundness**: identifier matching is name-only;
  a non-crypto project that defines its own `SHA256_Update` will fire.
  Short names (`rand`, `random`) have highest collision risk.

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-sites "$WORKDIR"
```

These are the *mechanical* halves of those sections — deterministic call
sites, no LLM. (Semantic analysis — refcount-protocol anomalies, ownership
transfers, privilege bypass paths, lock imbalance — is the LLM's job when
you populate the narrative. Lock *imbalance* specifically has its own
finding-style cocci at `engine/coccinelle/rules/lock_imbalance.cocci` for
the bug-shape; this enrichment is enumeration only.) Skip-silent: no-ops on
non-C/C++ targets or when `spatch` isn't on PATH, so it only adds a cocci
pass where it has something to find. Idempotent. Skip if
`$WORKDIR/checklist.json` lacks `target_path`.

**[MAP-5e] Enrich with frida runtime evidence (automatic)**

After normalisation, merge any frida runtime evidence discovered in sibling
run directories. This is automatic and best-effort — if no frida evidence
exists, it no-ops silently.

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-frida "$WORKDIR"
```

Merges function-level runtime observations (which functions were called, how
many times, with what arguments) from frida `events.jsonl` into the
context-map's entry points and sinks. Entry points and sinks that frida
confirmed at runtime get a `runtime_confirmed: true` annotation. Idempotent.
Skip-silent when no frida evidence is discoverable.

**[MAP-5f] Enrich with mechanically-discovered sinks and framework APIs**

After normalisation, run the sink enricher. Uses the call graph to:

* **Discover direct sinks** — functions that call dangerous targets
  (`os.execute`, `subprocess.Popen`, `eval`, `loadstring`, `io.popen`,
  etc.) — merged into `sink_details` with `source: "mechanical"`
* **Compute reverse reachability** — entry points that can transitively
  reach a dangerous sink through the call chain get a `reachable_sinks`
  field listing which dangerous targets are reachable
* **Discover framework APIs** — high-frequency call targets spanning
  many files, added to `meta.frameworks_discovered`. Autonomous — works
  for niche frameworks (LuCI, OpenResty) without a registry

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-sinks "$WORKDIR"
```

Language-agnostic: uses call graphs from any language extractor
(Python, JS, C, C++, Lua, Go, Java). Complements MAP-3 (LLM's sink
catalog) with mechanical ground truth. Limitation: reverse
reachability is intra-file only (same-file call edges); cross-file
call chains are visible to the LLM but not to this enricher.
Idempotent. Skip if `$WORKDIR/checklist.json` lacks `target_path`.

**[MAP-5g] Enrich sinks with target-mitigation context (optional)**

When `--binary <path>` was supplied, augment each sink under `sinks[]`
with a `mitigation_context` blob describing which classical exploitation
primitives (`arbitrary_write`, `%n write`, `got_overwrite`, `.fini_array`,
`hook_overwrite`, `stack_smash`) the target's build actually permits
given its NX / RELRO tier / canary / FORTIFY / glibc-`%n`-disabled
state. Each entry carries a `priority_hint` combining primitive
availability with the sink's CWE.

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-mitigation "$WORKDIR"
```

Opt-in — no-op when no binary path is available. Additive — sinks are
never dropped, only enriched. Namespaced under `source:
"exploit_feasibility.analyze_binary"` so parallel enrichers can coexist.
Tri-state honest — `format_n_write: null` means CONDITIONAL, distinct
from `false`; consumers must not collapse `null` to `false`. Cache-keyed
on `(binary_sha256, build_flags_source, schema_version)` — one
`analyze_binary` call per run. Idempotent.

**[MAP-5h] Build Joern CPG cache (optional)**

When Joern is available and the target contains C/C++/Java/Scala source,
pre-build a cached CPG so that later `/audit` and `/agentic` runs can
query callers/callees without the cold-start penalty:

```bash
libexec/raptor-build-cpg-cache "$RESOLVED_TARGET" "$WORKDIR"
```

Opt-in — skipped when Joern is not installed or the target has no
supported source files. Writes `cpg-cache-manifest.json` to `$WORKDIR`.

**[MAP-5i] Enrich with Joern taint-flow confirmation (optional)**

After building the CPG cache (MAP-5h), confirm which entry-point → sink
pairs have a mechanically-verified taint flow. Annotates entry points
with `has_taint_flow` and `taint_reaches_sinks`, sinks with
`taint_reached_from`, and adds a `taint_summary` to the context map.

```bash
libexec/raptor-enrich-context-map-taint "$WORKDIR"
```

Opt-in — skipped when no CPG cache exists or Joern is not installed.
Caps at 500 (entry × sink) pairs to prevent combinatorial explosion.
Idempotent. Downstream consumers: `/validate` Stage B imports
`has_taint_flow` via the understand bridge, pre-confirming B-3.1
reachability. `/diagram` renders confirmed flows as solid edges.

**[MAP-6] Record Coverage**

After writing `context-map.json`, update the inventory with which functions you examined.
Write a JSON array of every function you read and analysed (entry points, sinks, trust boundary
checks) to `$WORKDIR/reviewed-items.json`, then run the coverage recorder:

Record coverage using the understand command's Step 3:
```bash
libexec/raptor-coverage-summary "$WORKDIR" --mark src/routes/query.py:handle_query src/db/query.py:run_query
```

This updates the coverage record so `/project coverage` reflects what was examined.

**[MAP-7] Runtime Probe (optional)**

When the target ships an executable binary alongside the source —
e.g. a CLI tool, a built service, or a packaged scanner — you can
corroborate the static map with a runtime observation. The probe
runs the binary under `sandbox(observe=True)` and records every
path it reads/writes/stat's plus every connect target it attempts;
the resulting profile is merged into `context-map.json` under a
`runtime_observation` key with correlations against your entry
points and sinks.

This is **opt-in** because:
- many /understand targets don't have a runnable binary;
- probing executes the binary, which the operator must consent to;
- the observation is one execution path — entry points the binary
  didn't reach in this run aren't refuted, just unconfirmed.

Run the probe via the CLI shim and merge the JSON output:

```bash
raptor-sandbox-observe --json --out "$WORKDIR/probe" -- \
    /path/to/binary [args...] > "$WORKDIR/probe.json"

python3 -c "
import json
from pathlib import Path
from core.sandbox.observe_profile import (
    ConnectTarget, ObserveProfile,
)
from core.sandbox.observe_context_merge import (
    merge_observation_into_context_map,
)

w = Path('$WORKDIR')
ctx = json.loads((w / 'context-map.json').read_text())
probe = json.loads((w / 'probe.json').read_text())
profile = ObserveProfile(
    paths_read=probe['paths_read'],
    paths_written=probe['paths_written'],
    paths_stat=probe['paths_stat'],
    connect_targets=[
        ConnectTarget(**t) for t in probe['connect_targets']
    ],
)
merged = merge_observation_into_context_map(
    ctx, profile,
    binary='/path/to/binary',
    command=['/path/to/binary'] + ['<args>'],
)
(w / 'context-map.json').write_text(json.dumps(merged, indent=2))
"
```

After merge, `context-map.json` has a new `runtime_observation`
section with:
- the full path/connect record;
- `correlations.entry_points_runtime_confirmed`: IDs of entry
  points whose source file the binary actually opened;
- `correlations.sinks_runtime_confirmed`: IDs of sinks whose
  source file the binary opened for write;
- `correlations.external_reach`: list of ip:port the binary
  attempted (often complements egress proxy log).

When you display the MAP summary to the user, surface a runtime
section if `runtime_observation` is present:

> Runtime probe: N paths read, N writes, N connects.
> Confirmed entry points: EP-001, EP-007.
> Confirmed sink writes: SINK-002.

## Output

OUTPUT: `$WORKDIR/context-map.json`

Display a summary to the user after writing:
- N entry points found (N require auth, N are public)
- N trust boundaries found (N gaps identified)
- N sinks found (N have unchecked flows)
- Recommended next step: `--trace <entry-point-id>` for highest-risk unchecked flow
