# Biomaterials (biomaterials)

## Journal positioning

Biomaterials is an Elsevier journal for materials designed for biological and medical
application: tissue engineering and regenerative scaffolds, drug and gene delivery,
implants and coatings, and biointerfaces. Its defining demand is **dual rigor** — a
submission must combine thorough materials design and characterization *with* genuine
biological evaluation (in vitro and/or in vivo), and the two must be tied together by a
mechanism: how the material's properties produce the biological outcome. A strong
materials paper carrying only a token cell-viability assay, or a biology study using an
off-the-shelf material with no materials advance, is a poor fit. This skill is a **fit
/ venue-selection / re-framing** tool. It does not replace the journal's current
official author guidelines. Before submitting, re-check the live Biomaterials Guide for
Authors on the Elsevier site.

## When to trigger

- The author names Biomaterials for a tissue-engineering, delivery, implant, or
  biointerface manuscript and wants a fit/framing and dual-rigor check.
- A materials paper must be re-framed to add — and mechanistically connect — meaningful
  biological evaluation, or a biology paper must show a real materials advance.
- The author is choosing between Biomaterials, `nature-biomedical-engineering`, and the
  functional-materials family (`advanced-materials`, `nature-materials`).
- The author needs the journal's biological-evaluation bar and its desk-reject
  heuristics.

## Scope & topic fit

- Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine: scaffolds, hydrogels, and engineered
  matrices where material design drives a demonstrated cell/tissue response.
- Drug, gene, and cell delivery: carriers and depots characterized as materials and
  evaluated for loading, release, targeting, and biological efficacy.
- Implants, devices, and coatings: degradable and load-bearing materials with
  characterized properties and biological/host response.
- Biointerfaces and surface engineering: surface chemistry/topography linked
  mechanistically to protein adsorption, cell adhesion, or antifouling behavior.
- Immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and bioactive materials where the biological effect
  is traced to defined material properties.
- Nano/micro-structured biomaterials when the materials advance and the biological
  outcome are jointly established, not one without the other.

## Method & evidence bar

- The contribution must establish a **material-property-to-biological-outcome
  mechanism**, not merely report that a new material is biocompatible.
- Materials characterization must be thorough and appropriate: composition, structure,
  mechanical and degradation behavior, and release/loading where relevant, with
  quantitative, reproducible data.
- Biological evaluation must be meaningful and matched to the claim: appropriate cell
  types, relevant assays beyond a single viability test, and in-vivo validation where
  the application demands it — with controls, adequate N, and statistics.
- Properties and biological performance must be benchmarked against the correct
  material/clinical baseline, not a strawman.
- In-vivo work requires proper design (controls, randomization/blinding where
  applicable, ethics approval) and honest reporting of limitations.
- Reproducibility: material synthesis/processing, characterization protocols, and
  biological methods reported in enough detail to reproduce both the material and the
  measured response.

## Structure & house style

- Standard research-article structure (introduction, materials/methods, results,
  discussion); Biomaterials publishes full-length archival articles — re-check current
  article types and length on the live guide.
- The introduction motivates the biomedical problem and the materials-design rationale
  together; the discussion is where the structure–property–bioresponse mechanism is
  argued explicitly.
- Figures are load-bearing: materials characterization with quantification, and
  biological data (imaging, assays, in-vivo outcomes) with controls, error bars, and
  reported N and statistics.
- Supplementary material carries extended characterization and full biological
  protocols; main-text figures must support the central mechanism on their own.
- Ethics and biosafety statements must be present where animal or human-derived material
  is used.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the Elsevier anchors, then cite
  the current Biomaterials Guide for Authors page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Biomaterials guide for authors" and follow the current
  Elsevier/Editorial Manager version.
- Re-check article types, length/figure expectations, and the data-availability policy.
- Confirm ethics approval and animal-use (e.g., ARRIVE) reporting and any biosafety
  requirements for in-vitro/in-vivo work.
- Confirm graphical-abstract and highlights requirements if applicable.
- Re-check competing-interests, funding, author-contribution (CRediT), and AI-use
  disclosure requirements.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The paper establishes a material-property-to-biological-outcome mechanism, not just "biocompatible."
- [ ] Materials characterization is thorough and quantitative (structure, mechanics, degradation, release as relevant).
- [ ] Biological evaluation goes beyond a token viability assay, with appropriate cells/models, controls, N, and statistics.
- [ ] In-vivo work (where the claim needs it) has proper design and ethics approval.
- [ ] Properties and bioresponse are benchmarked against the correct material/clinical baseline.
- [ ] Synthesis, characterization, and biological protocols are reported in reproducible detail.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- A materials paper with a token cell-viability assay and no biological insight or mechanism.
- A biology study using an off-the-shelf material with no materials design or characterization advance.
- "New biomaterial, it's biocompatible" with no structure–property–bioresponse mechanism.
- Biological data with no controls, inadequate N, missing statistics, or absent ethics approval.
- Performance benchmarked against a strawman rather than the correct material/clinical baseline.
- Application-driven device paper where neither the materials nor the biology is advanced.

## Re-routing decision

- Engineering-/device-led biomedical advance with clinical translation focus → `nature-biomedical-engineering`.
- Conceptual functional-materials advance with the materials science as the core → `advanced-materials` / `nature-materials`.
- Specialty biomedical-engineering instrumentation/methods → `ieee-transactions-on-biomedical-engineering`.
- Broad cross-disciplinary significance → `nature-communications` / `science-advances`.
- Predominantly mechanistic biology with material as a tool → a dedicated cell/biology venue.
