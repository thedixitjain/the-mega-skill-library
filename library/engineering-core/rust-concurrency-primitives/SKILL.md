# Rust Concurrency Primitives

Use this skill to design thread-based Rust concurrency with explicit ownership,
sharing, and synchronization. Prefer the simplest primitive that matches the
coordination requirement before adding shared mutable state.

## Core Workflow

1. Classify the work: independent fork-join, producer/consumer pipeline, shared
   state, one-time initialization, or low-level atomic coordination.
2. Prefer owned data per thread. Add shared ownership only when data must be
   observed or mutated by multiple threads.
3. Use `std::thread::scope` when child threads can borrow stack data and must
   finish before the function returns.
4. Use channels for ownership transfer and pipelines. Use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or
   `Arc<RwLock<T>>` only when shared state is the clearer model.
5. Keep lock scopes short and never call user-controlled or blocking code while
   holding a lock unless that is the invariant being protected.
6. Use `OnceLock` or `LazyLock` for thread-safe one-time initialization instead
   of ad hoc global mutable state.
7. Treat atomics as a specialized tool. Use `SeqCst` by default until a weaker
   ordering is justified and documented.

## Primitive Selection

Read `references/threading-shared-state.md` before introducing a new shared
state primitive or reviewing deadlock-prone code.

| Need | Primitive |
|------|-----------|
| Borrow local data into short-lived threads | `std::thread::scope` |
| Transfer work or results | `std::sync::mpsc` or project channel crate |
| Shared read/write state | `Arc<Mutex<T>>` |
| Many readers, rare writers | `Arc<RwLock<T>>` |
| Wait for condition changes | `Condvar` with `Mutex` |
| One-time global initialization | `LazyLock` or `OnceLock` |
| Counters, flags, lock-free coordination | `std::sync::atomic` |

## Safety And Review Rules

- Require `Send` for values crossing thread boundaries and `Sync` for shared
  references used from multiple threads.
- Decide whether poisoning should propagate panic or recover with
  `PoisonError::into_inner`.
- Establish a lock ordering when more than one lock can be acquired.
- Prefer `Arc::clone(&value)` over `value.clone()` when the cloned value is an
  ownership handle and readability matters.
- Use Rayon for data parallel iteration when the problem is pure CPU data
  parallelism and the project already accepts that dependency.

## Tests

- Add deterministic tests around final state, message counts, and shutdown.
- Use barriers, channels, or scoped threads to coordinate tests; avoid sleeps.
- Add at least one test for panic, dropped sender/receiver, or cancellation
  behavior when the code depends on it.
