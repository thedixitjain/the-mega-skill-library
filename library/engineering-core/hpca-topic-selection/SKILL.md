# HPCA Topic Selection

Use this before committing a project to HPCA. The question is not "is this
architecture?" but "is the contribution a **measured microarchitectural cost met by a
buildable mechanism** whose behavior is shown on a credible instrument?" If yes, HPCA
fits; if the center of gravity is elsewhere, route deliberately.

## The three centers of gravity

Locate where the novelty actually lives:

- **The machine** — a new microarchitecture, structure, or organization is the point.
  Strong HPCA fit when the design is buildable and its behavior is measured.
- **The mechanism** — a control policy, prediction scheme, or protocol that improves
  an existing machine. HPCA fit when a quantified cost motivates it.
- **The measurement** — a characterization that becomes predictive or actionable.
  HPCA fit when the measurement yields a tool, not just an observation.

If the novelty is a pure algorithm with no machine consequence, or a full
language/OS/runtime co-design, HPCA is likely the wrong seat.

## Routing across the architecture year

| Signal | Likely venue |
|---|---|
| Measured cost → buildable mechanism, hardware-grade evaluation, ready by late July | **HPCA** |
| Broad "new idea in architecture," flagship framing, November-ready | ISCA |
| Microarchitecture depth, pipeline/structure focus, spring-ready | MICRO |
| Cross-layer co-design spanning architecture + PL/OS/runtime | ASPLOS |
| Deployed-system evidence rather than a research prototype | **HPCA Industry track** |
| Pure model/algorithm with no machine consequence | a theory or systems venue |

The calendar matters: HPCA's late-July deadline is the last major architecture gate
of the summer, so timing can decide routing as much as topic does. A project that
just missed a spring venue often lands naturally in the HPCA winter cycle.

## Main track vs Industry track

HPCA runs an **Industry track** alongside the main track. Route there when the
contribution is evidence from a *deployed or productized* system — the value is the
real-world measurement and the lessons, not a novel research mechanism. Route to the
main track when a new mechanism or machine is the claim.

## Fit test

Ask, in order:

1. **Is the cost measured?** Can you state the pathology this paper attacks with a
   number, before proposing the fix?
2. **Is the mechanism buildable?** Could a competent architect reimplement it from
   your description, with a stated hardware cost?
3. **Is the behavior shown on a credible instrument?** A cycle-level simulator with a
   declared fidelity scope, validated timing models, or real silicon with captured
   state?
4. **Does the contribution travel?** Would it generalize beyond one workload or one
   configuration?

Two or more "no" answers is a signal to sharpen the framing or re-route.

## Worked routing example

```text
[Project] A confidence-gated filter that suppresses useless irregular prefetches
[Center of gravity] mechanism (motivated by a measured bandwidth-waste cost)
[Cost measured?] yes — useless-traffic fraction on bandwidth-bound phases
[Buildable?] yes — one small table + gating logic, cost stated
[Instrument] cycle-level OoO sim + validated DRAM model
[Route] HPCA main track; if it were a deployed CPU's shipping prefetcher study -> Industry track
```

## Output format

```text
[Center of gravity] machine / mechanism / measurement
[HPCA fit] strong / plausible / weak
[Track] main / industry
[Fit-test failures] <which of the four questions answered "no">
[Recommended venue] HPCA / ISCA / MICRO / ASPLOS / other
[Reasoning] <one or two sentences>
```
