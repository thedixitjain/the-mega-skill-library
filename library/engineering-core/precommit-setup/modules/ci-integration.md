# CI Integration

Verify CI runs the same thorough checks that pre-commit
runs locally. Drift between local hooks and CI is the most
common cause of "works on my machine" PRs.

## GitHub Actions

\`\`\`yaml
# .github/workflows/quality.yml
name: Code Quality

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Install uv
        run: pip install uv

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync

      - name: Run Comprehensive Quality Checks
        run: ./scripts/check-all-quality.sh

      - name: Upload Coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
