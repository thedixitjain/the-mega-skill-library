# Performance and Troubleshooting

## Typical Timings

| Check | Single Component | Multiple Components | All Components |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Global Ruff | ~50ms | ~200ms | ~500ms |
| Global Mypy | ~200ms | ~500ms | ~1s |
| Component Lint | ~2-5s | ~4-10s | ~30-60s |
| Component Typecheck | ~3-8s | ~6-16s | ~60-120s |
| Component Tests | ~5-15s | ~10-30s | ~120-180s |
| **Total** | **~10-30s** | **~20-60s** | **~2-5min** |

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Only test changed components**: default behavior in
   the Layer 2 scripts.
2. **Parallel execution**: pre-commit runs hooks
   concurrently when possible.
3. **Caching**: dependencies cached by uv; mypy uses
   `.mypy_cache/`.
4. **Incremental mypy**: enable `--incremental` for repeat
   commits in the same session.

## Hooks Too Slow

Only changed components are checked by default. For even
faster commits during active development:

\`\`\`bash
# Skip tests during development
SKIP=run-component-tests git commit -m "WIP: feature development"

# Run tests manually when ready
./scripts/run-component-tests.sh --changed
\`\`\`

## Cache Issues

\`\`\`bash
# Clear pre-commit cache
uv run pre-commit clean

# Clear component caches
find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name ".pytest_cache" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name ".mypy_cache" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
\`\`\`

## Hook Failures

\`\`\`bash
# See detailed output
uv run pre-commit run --verbose --all-files

# Run specific component checks manually
cd plugins/my-component
make lint
make typecheck
make test
\`\`\`

## Import Errors in Tests

\`\`\`toml
# Ensure PYTHONPATH is set in pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["src"]
\`\`\`

## Type Checking Errors

**Fix the implementation first.** A typecheck error
almost always points at a real bug: a value that
might be `None`, a return type that doesn't match,
a function that lies about its signature. Loosening
the typechecker hides the bug; it does not solve it.

Only reach for per-module overrides as a last resort,
after confirming the error reflects a deliberate
escape hatch (e.g. interop with an untyped third-party
library you cannot annotate). When you do override,
narrow the scope tightly and leave a comment naming
the underlying issue.

\`\`\`toml
# LAST RESORT: fix the implementation before reaching for this.
# Narrow the scope to the offending module only; do not blanket-disable.
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "legacy_module.*"
disallow_untyped_defs = false  # tracked: <issue link>
\`\`\`
