# Rust Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineer Rust-compiled binaries methodically. Start with fast triage, confirm that the target is actually Rust, recover namespaces and runtime clues, then move into static or dynamic analysis with a clear hypothesis.

Do **not** jump straight into decompiler output and treat it as source truth. Rust binaries often contain compiler-generated glue, monomorphized generic code, panic paths, and async state machines that will drown the signal if you skip the triage stage.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- analyze a Rust executable, shared library, static archive, `.rlib`, or object file
- confirm whether a binary was built from Rust
- demangle Rust symbols and recover likely crate namespaces
- trace entry points, panic/unwind paths, FFI exports/imports, or async executors
- understand high-level architecture without source code
- prepare a Rust binary for deeper work in Ghidra, IDA, Binary Ninja, `gdb`, or `lldb`

## When NOT to Use

Do **not** use this skill when:

- the user already has the Rust source code and wants normal code review or debugging
- the target is primarily an Android APK/DEX/JAR/AAR package — use an Android-focused workflow instead
- the task is generic PE/ELF malware triage with no Rust-specific angle
- the request is to bypass licensing, DRM, or authorization controls on software the user is not authorized to analyze

## Prerequisites

Required command-line tools:

- `file`
- `strings`
- `readelf` or `llvm-readelf` for ELF, or `otool` for Mach-O
- `nm` or `llvm-nm`
- `objdump` or `llvm-objdump`, or `otool` on macOS

Recommended:

- `rustfilt`
- `gdb` or `lldb`
- Ghidra, IDA Pro, or Binary Ninja

Verify availability first:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/check-deps.sh
```

If tooling is missing, install one dependency at a time:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/install-dep.sh rustfilt
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/install-dep.sh ghidra
```

If automatic installation is not possible on the current machine, read `references/setup-guide.md`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Check and install dependencies

Run the dependency checker first:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/check-deps.sh
```

Parse the output looking for:

- `INSTALL_REQUIRED:`
- `INSTALL_OPTIONAL:`

If required tooling is missing, install it one dependency at a time:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/install-dep.sh <dependency>
```

The installer:

- uses Homebrew when available on macOS
- uses `apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman` on Linux when available
- uses `cargo install rustfilt` for `rustfilt` when `cargo` exists
- prints exact manual instructions and exits when a dependency cannot be installed automatically

For optional tooling, recommend at least:

- `rustfilt`
- one debugger: `gdb` or `lldb`
- `ghidra`

Re-run `check-deps.sh` after installation attempts. Do not proceed until all required dependencies show `OK`.

### Phase 2: Materialize reverse-engineering artifacts first

Do not keep the analysis ephemeral. Create an artifact bundle on disk before doing interpretation.

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/collect-artifacts.sh /path/to/binary
```

The script writes a reusable output directory:

```text
<target>-reverse-output/
├── input/
├── triage/
├── symbols/
├── headers/
├── disassembly/
├── decompiled/
│   └── ghidra/
└── reports/
```

Treat this directory as the source of truth for the rest of the workflow. It should contain:

- `triage/summary.txt` — file type, architecture, strip/debug-info status, Rust confidence
- `triage/strings.txt` and `triage/interesting-strings.txt` — raw and filtered strings
- `symbols/raw.txt`, `symbols/demangled.txt`, `symbols/namespaces.txt`, `symbols/imports.txt`, `symbols/exports.txt`
- `headers/*` — readelf, otool, or PE header dumps
- `disassembly/disassembly.txt` — best-effort disassembly when available
- `decompiled/ghidra/status.txt`, `summary.txt`, `functions.tsv`, `decompile-errors.tsv`, and `functions/*.c` — headless Ghidra pseudocode artifacts when available
- `reports/summary.md` and `reports/pattern-hits.txt`

### Phase 3: Fast triage before any deep analysis

If you need a quick rerun or a narrower pass, the underlying triage script is still available.

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/triage.sh /path/to/binary
```

Capture these facts before doing anything else:

1. **Container and file type**
   - ELF, Mach-O, PE/COFF, static archive, object file, or `.rlib`
   - target architecture and bitness
   - executable vs shared library vs archive

2. **Symbol quality**
   - stripped vs not stripped
   - exported vs imported symbols
   - whether a usable symbol table still exists

3. **Debug-info availability**
   - DWARF sections
   - macOS DWARF segments / dSYM hints
   - Windows PDB hints in strings
   - split-debug or external-debug indicators when visible

4. **Rust confidence**
   - v0 or legacy Rust mangling patterns
   - demangled `core::`, `alloc::`, `std::`, or crate-like namespaces
   - panic/unwind strings and runtime artifacts
   - Rust-specific crate names in symbols or strings

Do not describe the binary as “definitely Rust” from a single clue. Use multiple, independent signals.

### Phase 4: Recover symbols and namespaces

Dump symbols and demangle them as early as possible.

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/demangle-symbols.sh /path/to/binary
```

Focus on these buckets:

- **standard runtime buckets**: `core::`, `alloc::`, `std::`, `panic`, unwinding, formatting
- **user-space buckets**: crate-like top-level namespaces that are not runtime crates
- **interop buckets**: `main`, `_start`, exported C ABI functions, imported libc / Win32 / networking APIs
- **framework buckets**: likely third-party crates such as serialization, async runtimes, HTTP stacks, crypto, CLI parsing, and logging

Build a short namespace inventory:

```text
- runtime crates:
- likely app crates:
- likely third-party crates:
- exported ABI functions:
- imported platform APIs:
```

Use `references/triage-and-fingerprinting.md` for the triage rubric and `references/rust-patterns.md` for common Rust-specific fingerprints.

For targeted bucket searches across the generated artifacts, run:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/find-rust-patterns.sh <target>-reverse-output
```

### Phase 5: Recover high-level structure without assuming a stable Rust ABI

Recover structure conservatively.

Look for:

1. **Entry and boundary functions**
   - `_start`, `main`, CRT glue, loader entry points
   - exported `extern "C"` / `no_mangle` style boundaries
   - plugin or callback registration functions
   - thread starts, task executors, and worker loops

2. **Subsystem anchors**
   - config parsing
   - logging initialization
   - network / filesystem / crypto imports
   - panic setup and error paths
   - serialization and IPC edges

3. **Call-shape clues**
   - large dispatcher-style functions that may be async state machines
   - indirect calls through vtable-like structures
   - formatter-heavy branches around error handling or panic paths
   - repeated monomorphized helpers with type-specific variants

Critical rule: **do not assume undocumented Rust layouts are stable**.

- Treat `Option`, `Result`, `Vec`, `String`, trait objects, and closure layouts as hypotheses until confirmed by debug info, repeated call-site evidence, or explicit `repr(C)` / `repr(transparent)` style interop boundaries.
- Do not label every two-word structure as a trait object.
- Do not infer source-level module boundaries from one demangled symbol alone; confirm using clusters of neighboring symbols, xrefs, and strings.

### Phase 6: Static analysis in a decompiler / disassembler

Once triage is complete, load the target into Ghidra, IDA, or Binary Ninja.

If `analyzeHeadless` is installed, `collect-artifacts.sh` should already materialize a decompiler bundle under `decompiled/ghidra/`. Treat those `.c` files as working pseudocode and review aids, not as original Rust source.

If the target is a universal Mach-O, thin it to the slice you actually want to analyze before trusting any disassembly or decompiler output. The automation now does this for you, defaulting to the host architecture when `--macho-arch` is omitted and recording the chosen slice in `input/analysis-target.txt` and `decompiled/ghidra/analysis-target.txt`. If the host slice is not the slice you want, pass `--macho-arch` explicitly.

Do not treat the export as complete until `decompiled/ghidra/status.txt` says `STATE: completed` or `decompiled/ghidra/complete.marker` exists. The export now writes progress and partial summary state during the run, so interrupted batches are clearly marked as partial or failed instead of looking empty.

Inside Codex, long-running Ghidra exports must stay attached to a live session and be allowed to run until `STATE: completed`. Do not interrupt them just because they are slow. Do not stop because “enough signal was gathered”, because the expected remaining value seems low, or because the auto-analysis phase looks quiet for a while. If the process is alive and `decompiled/ghidra/runner-status.txt` is still getting fresh heartbeats, the job is still in progress.

Use `decompiled/ghidra/runner-status.txt` to distinguish “slow but alive” from “actually stopped”, and use `decompiled/ghidra/warning-summary.txt` to see whether a small set of hotspot functions is dominating the `Unable to resolve constructor` / `pcode error` noise in `headless.log`. A fresh runner heartbeat together with `PROCESS_ALIVE: yes` means the export is still live. For detached jobs, `ghidra-job.sh status` now derives `RUNNER_HEARTBEAT_AGE_SECONDS`, `RUNNER_HEARTBEAT_STALE`, and `LIVENESS_HINT` so you can separate a slow analysis phase from a dead wrapper.

Recommended order:

1. Run auto-analysis
2. Apply or verify Rust demangling
3. Rename obvious runtime buckets away from the app-specific namespace inventory
4. Start from one of:
   - exported C ABI functions
   - `main` / startup glue
   - strong strings with xrefs
   - networking / filesystem imports
   - panic and formatting anchors
5. Label crate clusters and subsystem boundaries
6. Trace only one feature path at a time

Prefer **strings, imports, exports, and clear subsystem anchors** over huge decompiler functions. In stripped Rust binaries, anchor-based analysis is more reliable than trying to understand every generic helper.

Use `references/static-analysis-workflow.md` for the detailed workflow.

### Phase 7: Dynamic analysis when static evidence is weak

When stripped code or compiler-generated glue makes static analysis ambiguous, move to a debugger.

Use `gdb` or `lldb` to:

- break at exported ABI functions or `main`
- watch network, file I/O, process creation, and crypto-adjacent imports
- break on panic / abort paths
- confirm which indirect call sites are real dispatch points
- trace buffer lifetimes and ownership hand-offs across FFI boundaries

Dynamic analysis is especially valuable for:

- heavily stripped binaries
- async runtimes
- plugin or callback architectures
- binaries with large amounts of monomorphized generic code
- distinguishing app logic from runtime support

Use `references/dynamic-analysis-notes.md` for breakpoint ideas and debugger notes.

### Phase 8: Produce a structured report

At the end, deliver both the artifact bundle and a structured report.

The artifact bundle should exist on disk and include at least:

1. **Captured input and triage**
   - original target under `input/`
   - triage summary
   - raw and filtered strings

2. **Recovered symbol artifacts**
   - raw symbols
   - demangled symbols
   - namespace histogram
   - imports and exports

3. **Low-level evidence**
   - header dumps
   - disassembly when available
   - grouped pattern hits
   - Ghidra pseudocode files when headless export is available

4. **Human-readable report**
   - `reports/summary.md`

Then, in the chat response, deliver:

1. **Binary fingerprint**
   - format, architecture, strip/debug-info status, Rust confidence

2. **Namespace inventory**
   - runtime crates
   - likely application crates
   - likely third-party crates

3. **Entry points and boundaries**
   - startup path
   - exported functions
   - imported APIs
   - likely FFI edges

4. **Recovered subsystems**
   - networking
   - storage
   - crypto
   - config
   - async/task execution
   - panic/error handling

5. **Key call flows**
   - one or two high-value paths only
   - note confidence and evidence for each path

6. **Open questions**
   - what remains ambiguous
   - what extra evidence is needed next (debug info, runtime breakpoints, comparison build, related library)

## Rationalizations to Reject

Reject these shortcuts:

- “The decompiler said it, so it must be true.”
- “This looks like a trait object because it has two pointers.”
- “Demangled symbols prove the original source layout.”
- “A crate name in strings means the feature is definitely used.”
- “This large dispatcher is obviously business logic.”  
  It may just be compiler-generated async or panic/runtime machinery.

## Output standard

Always mention the output directory first, then summarize the findings.

Use this format when reporting to the user:

```markdown
## Reverse output

- **Output dir**: `path/to/target-reverse-output`
- **Summary report**: `path/to/target-reverse-output/reports/summary.md`

## Rust binary summary

- **Target**: `path/to/binary`
- **Format / arch**: `ELF x86-64`
- **Symbols**: `partially stripped`
- **Debug info**: `DWARF absent`
- **Rust confidence**: `high`

## Namespaces

- **Runtime crates**: `core`, `alloc`, `std`
- **Likely app crates**: `my_app`, `engine`
- **Likely third-party crates**: `tokio`, `serde_json`, `reqwest`

## Entry points and boundaries

- **Startup**: `_start -> ... -> main`
- **Exports**: `plugin_init`, `process_request`
- **Imports**: `connect`, `send`, `recv`, `pthread_create`
- **FFI edges**: `plugin_init`, `process_request`

## Key findings

1. `process_request` appears to drive the request parsing path.
2. Networking likely flows through a `reqwest`/`hyper`-adjacent stack.
3. A large dispatcher near `...::poll` is a strong async-state-machine candidate.

## Next best move

- break on `process_request`
- trace the async poll path
- inspect nearby strings/xrefs for request routing or serialization formats
```
