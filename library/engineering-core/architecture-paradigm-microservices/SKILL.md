# The Microservices Architecture Paradigm

## When to Employ This Paradigm
- When the organizational structure requires high levels of team autonomy and independent release cycles.
- When different business capabilities (bounded contexts) have distinct scaling requirements or would benefit from different technology stacks.
- When there is a significant organizational commitment to investing in DevOps and SRE maturity, including advanced observability, CI/CD, and incident response capabilities.

## When NOT To Use This Paradigm
- When team size is small and organizational complexity is low
- When lack of DevOps maturity or limited platform engineering resources
- When system requires strong transactional consistency across operations
- When early-stage startup with rapidly evolving requirements
- When regulatory constraints make distributed data management challenging

## Adoption Steps
1. **Define Bounded Contexts**: Map each microservice to a clear business capability and establish unambiguous data ownership.
2. **validate Service Data Autonomy**: Each service must own and control its own database or persistence mechanism. All data sharing between services must occur via APIs or events, not shared tables.
3. **Build a production-grade Platform**: Before deploying services, establish foundational infrastructure for service discovery, distributed tracing, centralized logging, CI/CD templates, and automated contract testing.
4. **Design for Resilience**: Implement resilience patterns such as timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, and bulkheads for all inter-service communication. Formally document Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Objectives (SLOs).
5. **Automate Governance**: Implement automated processes to enforce security scanning, dependency management policies, and consistent versioning strategies across all services.

## Key Deliverables
- An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) cataloging all service boundaries, their corresponding data stores, and their communication patterns (e.g., synchronous API vs. asynchronous events).
- A set of "golden path" templates and runbooks for creating and operating new services on the platform.
- A detailed testing strategy that includes unit, contract, integration, and chaos/resilience tests.

## Technology Guidance

**API Communication**:
- **REST APIs**: Spring Boot (Java), Express.js (Node.js), FastAPI (Python)
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Server (Node.js), Hasura (PostgreSQL)
- **gRPC**: gRPC frameworks for high-performance internal communication

**Service Discovery & Configuration**:
- **Service Registry**: Consul, Eureka, etcd
- **Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Parameter Store

**Message Broking & Events**:
- **Message Brokers**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS/SNS
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, AWS Kinesis

**Observability**:
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch
- **Logging**: ELK Stack, Fluentd, Splunk

## Real-World Examples

**Netflix**: Video streaming platform with hundreds of microservices handling different aspects like playback, recommendation, billing, and user authentication. Each team can deploy independently without affecting others.

**Amazon**: E-commerce platform with separate services for product catalog, order processing, payment, inventory, and shipping. Enables independent scaling during high-traffic events like Prime Day.

**Uber**: Ride-sharing platform with microservices for rider matching, driver dispatch, pricing, payment processing, and notifications, allowing rapid feature development and deployment.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Distributed System Complexity**:
  - **Mitigation**: The operational overhead for a microservices architecture is substantial. Invest in dedicated platform teams and shared tooling to manage this complexity and provide support for service teams.
- **Data Consistency Challenges**:
  - **Mitigation**: Maintaining data consistency across services is a primary challenge. Employ patterns like Sagas for orchestrating transactions, validate message-based communication is idempotent, and use reconciliation jobs to handle eventual consistency.
- **Incorrect Service Granularity ("Over-splitting")**:
  - **Mitigation**: If services are too small, the communication overhead can outweigh the benefits of distribution. validate each service owns a meaningful and substantial piece of functionality. Monitor change coupling between services to identify candidates for merging.

## Concrete Components

These vocabulary items name the concrete tools and abstractions
that show up when the paradigm is implemented. They are not
required dependencies and they are not part of the skill's
``tools:`` frontmatter (which is reserved for Claude Code tool
restrictions). Use this list to disambiguate during architecture
discussions.

- ``service-boundary-analyzer``: finds candidate seams via call-graph and data-ownership analysis
- ``api-contract-generator``: OpenAPI/protobuf scaffolding for new service boundaries
- ``resilience-patterns``: retry, circuit breaker, bulkhead, and timeout libraries

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] An ADR catalogs all service boundaries with their data stores and communication patterns
  (synchronous API vs. asynchronous events) before any service is deployed independently.
- [ ] Each service owns its own database or persistence mechanism; no service reads another
  service's tables directly (verified via data-ownership review).
- [ ] Resilience patterns (timeout, retry, circuit breaker, bulkhead) are documented and
  implemented for every inter-service call before the service goes to production.
- [ ] "Golden path" runbooks for creating and operating new services exist before a second team
  begins adopting the architecture.
