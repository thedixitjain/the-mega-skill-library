# Bloat Detector

Systematically detect and eliminate codebase bloat through progressive analysis tiers.

## Bloat Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Code** | Dead code, God classes, Lava flow, duplication |
| **AI-Generated** | Tab-completion bloat, vibe coding, hallucinated deps |
| **Documentation** | Redundancy, verbosity, stale content, slop |
| **Dependencies** | Unused imports, dependency bloat, phantom packages |
| **Git History** | Stale files, low-churn code, massive single commits |

## Quick Start

### Tier 1: Quick Scan (2-5 min, no tools)
```bash
/bloat-scan
```
Detects: Large files, stale code, old TODOs, commented blocks, basic duplication

### Tier 2: Targeted Analysis (10-20 min, optional tools)
```bash
/bloat-scan --level 2 --focus code   # or docs, deps
```
Adds: Static analysis (Vulture/Knip), git churn hotspots, doc similarity

### Tier 3: Deep Audit (30-60 min, full tooling)
```bash
/bloat-scan --level 3 --report audit.md
```
Adds: Cross-file redundancy, dependency graphs, readability metrics

## When To Use

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Context usage > 30% | Active feature development |
| Quarterly maintenance | Time-sensitive bugs |
| Pre-release cleanup | Codebase < 1000 lines |
| Before major refactoring | Tools unavailable (Tier 2/3) |

## When NOT To Use

- Active feature development
- Time-sensitive bugs
- Codebase < 1000 lines

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Confidence | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| HIGH | 90-100% | Safe to remove |
| MEDIUM | 70-89% | Review first |
| LOW | 50-69% | Investigate |

## Prioritization

```
Priority = (Token_Savings × 0.4) + (Maintenance × 0.3) + (Confidence × 0.2) + (Ease × 0.1)
```

## Module Architecture

**Tier 1** (always available):
- See `modules/quick-scan.md` - Heuristics, no tools
- See `modules/git-history-analysis.md` - Staleness, churn, vibe coding signatures
- See `modules/growth-analysis.md` - Growth velocity, forecasts, threshold alerts

**Tier 2** (optional tools):
- See `modules/code-bloat-patterns.md` - Anti-patterns (God class, Lava flow)
- See `modules/ai-generated-bloat.md` - AI-specific patterns (Tab bloat, hallucinations)
- See `modules/documentation-bloat.md` - Redundancy, readability, slop detection
- See `modules/static-analysis-integration.md` - Vulture, Knip

**Shared**:
- See `modules/remediation-types.md` - DELETE, REFACTOR, CONSOLIDATE, ARCHIVE

## Ecosystem-Level Detection

Patterns that span plugin boundaries or manifest configuration,
discovered through ecosystem-wide audits.

### `alwaysApply` Accumulation

Flag plugins with 3+ skills where `alwaysApply: true`.
Each always-on skill injects its full text into every session,
creating a baseline token floor before the user types anything.
Sum the `estimated_tokens` fields to report total per-session cost.

### Hook Registration Gaps

Compare hooks declared in `plugin.json` or `openpackage.yml`
against entries in `hooks.json`. A hook present in `hooks.json`
but absent from the manifest is invisible to the plugin loader
and cannot be audited, versioned, or disabled through normal
plugin management.

### Boilerplate Footer Detection

Scan skill files for identical multi-line text blocks repeated
across 10+ files (e.g., generic troubleshooting sections like
"Command not found / Permission errors / Unexpected behavior").
These are copy-paste artifacts that inflate token cost without
adding skill-specific value.

### ToC Bloat in Skills

Skills loaded into model context gain nothing from HTML-style
Tables of Contents. Detect `## Table of Contents` followed by
bulleted anchor-link lists. These waste tokens since
the model reads sequentially, not via hyperlinks.

### Unregistered Module Subdirectories

Compare files on disk in `skills/*/modules/` against the
`modules:` list in each skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Files
that exist on disk but are not listed in the manifest are
invisible to progressive loading and may be dead weight or
missing from the load path.

## Auto-Exclusions

Always excludes: `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `vendor`

Also respects: `.gitignore`, `.bloat-ignore`

## Safety

- **Never auto-delete** - all changes require approval
- **Dry-run support** - `--dry-run` for previews
- **Backup branches** - created before bulk changes

## Related

- `bloat-auditor` agent - Executes scans
- `unbloat-remediator` agent - Safe remediation
- `context-optimization` skill - MECW principles
- `/bloat-scan` command - User-facing slash command that invokes this
  skill; there is no separate `bloat-scan` skill

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] At least one tier of scan (Tier 1, 2, or 3) completed and
  findings listed per bloat category (Code, AI-Generated,
  Documentation, Dependencies, Git History)
- [ ] Each finding assigned a confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) and
  a priority score computed from the formula
  `(Token_Savings × 0.4) + (Maintenance × 0.3) + (Confidence × 0.2)
  + (Ease × 0.1)`
- [ ] No auto-deletions executed without explicit user approval;
  every proposed removal documented as DELETE, REFACTOR,
  CONSOLIDATE, or ARCHIVE per `modules/remediation-types.md`
- [ ] Ecosystem-level patterns checked (alwaysApply accumulation,
  hook registration gaps, boilerplate footers, ToC bloat) if the
  scan target contains plugin directories
