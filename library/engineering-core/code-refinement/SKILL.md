# Code Refinement Workflow

Analyze and improve living code quality across six dimensions.

## Quick Start

```bash
/refine-code
/refine-code --level 2 --focus duplication
/refine-code --level 3 --report refinement-plan.md
```

## When To Use

- After rapid AI-assisted development sprints
- Before major releases (quality gate)
- When code "works but smells"
- Refactoring existing modules for clarity
- Reducing technical debt in living code

## When NOT To Use

- Removing
  dead/unused code (use conserve:bloat-detector)

## Analysis Dimensions

| # | Dimension | Module | What It Catches |
|---|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Duplication & Redundancy | `duplication-analysis` | Near-identical blocks, similar functions, copy-paste |
| 2 | Algorithmic Efficiency | `algorithm-efficiency` | O(n^2) where O(n) works, unnecessary iterations |
| 3 | Clean Code Violations | `clean-code-checks` | Long methods, deep nesting, poor naming, magic values |
| 4 | Architectural Fit | `architectural-fit` | Paradigm mismatches, coupling violations, leaky abstractions |
| 5 | Anti-Slop Patterns | `clean-code-checks` | Premature abstraction, enterprise cosplay, hollow patterns |
| 6 | Error Handling | `clean-code-checks` | Bare excepts, swallowed errors, happy-path-only |
| 7 | Additive Bias | `imbue:justify` | Workarounds over root fixes, test tampering, unnecessary additions |

## Plugin-Specific Patterns

Detection patterns for plugin and skill codebases where
standard code quality heuristics miss structural issues.

### Delegation Stub Bodies

A skill that declares "delegates to X" but still carries the
full template body is doing double duty. The delegating skill
should be a thin wrapper (under 30 lines) that routes to the
target. Flag any delegating skill whose body exceeds 50 lines.

### Module Explosion

Flag skills with 10+ module files where 40% or more of content
overlaps. Signal: two modules covering the same API surface
from different angles (e.g., both describing the same config
options or the same CLI flags).

### Oversized Single Modules

Flag individual module files exceeding 500 lines as candidates
for splitting or trimming. Large modules defeat progressive
loading by forcing full-file reads for partial information.

### Dead Python References

Skills referencing Python commands (`python -m module.name` or
`python -c "from module import ..."`) where the referenced
module does not exist in the plugin's `src/` directory. These
are stale references to renamed or removed code.

## Progressive Loading

Load modules based on refinement focus:

- **`modules/duplication-analysis.md`** (~400 tokens): Duplication detection and consolidation
- **`modules/algorithm-efficiency.md`** (~400 tokens): Complexity analysis and optimization
- **`modules/clean-code-checks.md`** (~450 tokens): Clean code, anti-slop, error handling
- **`modules/architectural-fit.md`** (~400 tokens): Paradigm alignment and coupling

Load all for thorough refinement. For focused work, load only relevant modules.

## Required TodoWrite Items

1. `refine:context-established`: Scope, language, framework detection
2. `refine:scan-complete`: Findings across all dimensions
3. `refine:prioritized`: Findings ranked by impact and effort
4. `refine:plan-generated`: Concrete refactoring plan with before/after
5. `refine:evidence-captured`: Evidence appendix per `imbue:proof-of-work`
6. `refine:findings-verified`: Citations confirmed by `citation_verifier.py`
7. `refine:execution-complete`: All wave-listed candidates closed-or-rationale'd (only required when invocation includes "execute findings" or stronger; see Step 6)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Context (`refine:context-established`)

Detect project characteristics:
```bash
# Language detection
find . -not -path "*/.venv/*" -not -path "*/__pycache__/*" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" \
  \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.go" \) \
  | head -20

# Framework detection
ls package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod 2>/dev/null

# Size assessment
find . -not -path "*/.venv/*" -not -path "*/__pycache__/*" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" \
  \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.rs" \) \
  | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | tail -1
```

### Step 2: Dimensional Scan (`refine:scan-complete`)

Load relevant modules and execute analysis per tier level.
For dimension 7 (Additive Bias), run `Skill(imbue:justify)`
to compute the bias score, check Iron Law compliance,
and flag unnecessary additions or workarounds.

### Step 3: Prioritize (`refine:prioritized`)

Rank findings by:
- **Impact**: How much quality improves (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Effort**: Lines changed, files touched (SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
- **Risk**: Likelihood of introducing bugs (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

Priority = HIGH impact + SMALL effort + LOW risk first.

### Step 4: Generate Plan (`refine:plan-generated`)

For each finding, produce:
- File path and line range
- Anchor: verbatim source text at the cited line
- Current code snippet
- Proposed improvement
- Rationale (which principle/dimension)
- Estimated effort

### Step 5: Evidence Capture (`refine:evidence-captured`)

Document with `imbue:proof-of-work` (if available):
- `[E1]`, `[E2]` references for each finding
- Metrics before/after where measurable
- Principle violations cited

**Fallback**: If `imbue` is not installed, capture evidence inline in the report using the same `[E1]` reference format without TodoWrite integration.

### Step 6: Execute Findings (`refine:execution-complete`)

Steps 1-5 produce a **plan**. Steps 6 produces **closures**. Both are part of the skill. Execution does not stop at planning unless the user explicitly says "plan only".

#### Execution mode detection

Match the user's invocation phrasing against this table to determine execution scope:

| User said | Mode | Stop when |
|---|---|---|
| `/code-refinement` (no qualifier) | **Plan only** | After Step 5 |
| `--dry-run` or "just plan" | **Plan only** | After Step 5 |
| "execute findings" / "apply fixes" | **Plan, execute Wave 1** | After all SMALL-effort, and LOW-risk findings closed |
| "execute all findings" / "all phases" / "all waves" | **Plan and execute every wave** | After every finding (or every wave-listed candidate) is either closed by commit or has explicit per-item rationale in the synthesis |
| "ignore scope guard" | **Override branch-size limits** | Branch metrics do not gate execution. Continue past RED zone. |
| "do not stop until complete" / "until ALL ... complete" | **No mid-task summaries** | Only declare done when synthesis has every wave-listed candidate closed-or-rationale'd |

The triggers compose: `--tier 3 --execute all findings --ignore-scope-guard` means run every Wave 2 and Wave 3 candidate to closure regardless of branch size.

#### Completion gate (when execution mode is active)

The task is **not complete** until ALL of the following hold:

1. **Wave 2 candidates** (medium-effort, listed in synthesis "Wave 2 Candidates" section): every entry has either a closure commit or an explicit per-item line in the synthesis stating why it is not viable.
2. **Wave 3 candidates** (large-effort, listed in synthesis "Wave 3 Candidates" section): same gate. Do not pre-emptively defer LARGE-effort items with generic "needs dedicated PR" rationale when the user said "execute all". Execute the mechanical ones (split-by-class, mixin-package, module-merge) and reserve "deferred" only for items requiring architecture-level decisions (schema changes, new dependency declarations, new venv layouts).
3. **Synthesis updated**: `docs/refinement/<date>/00-synthesis.md` records every closure with its commit SHA and every deferral with one-sentence rationale.

#### Anti-pattern detector for the agent itself

If the model finds itself doing any of the following during execution, this is a stop-hook leak. Go back to executing findings:

| Anti-pattern | Recognise as |
|---|---|
| "Wave 2 closed. Moving to Wave 3." (mid-run summary) | Premature turn-completion signal: keep working |
| "Documenting deferred items with rationale" before all mechanical items are done | Skipping execution under a paper trail |
| Writing a completion summary while >0 listed candidates lack closure-or-rationale | Violation of completion gate |
| Re-asking user "should I continue?" when invocation included "do not stop" | Ignoring the explicit no-mid-task-summary contract |

If the harness fires a stop signal mid-execution and the completion gate is not met, immediately resume with the next finding.

### Verify Findings Are Grounded (`refine:findings-verified`)

Every finding must cite a real location and a verbatim anchor. Write
findings to `.review/findings.json` and confirm each citation resolves:

```bash
python plugins/imbue/scripts/citation_verifier.py \
  --findings .review/findings.json --repo-root .
```

Drop or label `UNVERIFIED` any finding the verifier fails (exit `1`); only
verified findings enter the report. See `Skill(imbue:review-core)` Step 5
and `Skill(imbue:structured-output)` for the schema.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] All six analysis dimensions have a verdict (finding or "no issue
      detected") for the target scope.
- [ ] Each finding includes a file path, line range, and verbatim
      `Anchor` (the exact source text at that line).
- [ ] Every reported finding carries a `Location` + verbatim `Anchor`
      confirmed by `citation_verifier.py` (exit `0`), or unverified
      findings were dropped or labeled `UNVERIFIED`.

## Tiered Analysis

| Tier | Time | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| **1: Quick** (default) | 2-5 min | Complexity hotspots, obvious duplication, naming, magic values |
| **2: Targeted** | 10-20 min | Algorithm analysis, full duplication scan, architectural alignment |
| **3: Deep** | 30-60 min | All above and cross-module coupling, paradigm fitness, thorough plan |

## Cross-Plugin Dependencies

| Dependency | Required? | Fallback |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `imbue:proof-of-work` | Optional | Inline evidence in report |
| `conserve:code-quality-principles` | Optional | Built-in KISS/YAGNI/SOLID checks |
| `archetypes:architecture-paradigms` | Optional | Principle-based checks only (no paradigm detection) |

## Supporting Modules

- [Code quality analysis](modules/code-quality-analysis.md) - duplication detection commands and consolidation strategies

When optional plugins are not installed, the skill degrades gracefully:
- Without `imbue`: Evidence captured inline, no TodoWrite proof-of-work
- Without `conserve`: Uses built-in clean code checks (subset)
- Without `archetypes`: Skips paradigm-specific alignment, uses coupling/cohesion principles only
