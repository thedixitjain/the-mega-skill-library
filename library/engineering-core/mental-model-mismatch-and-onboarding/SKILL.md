# Mental-model mismatches and onboarding

When the user's mental model and the system's actual behavior diverge, three things can be done: change the system to match the user's model; change the user's model through onboarding and teaching; or surface the divergence so the user knows when their model doesn't apply.

## Diagnosing mismatches

Common signals of mental-model mismatch:

- **Repeated support tickets** about the same misunderstanding ("Why doesn't X work?" when X works fine — the user's expectation didn't match).
- **Drop-off at the same flow step** (the user reached this step expecting one thing; got another; left).
- **High undo / cancel rate** at a particular action.
- **Forum / community questions** asking how to do things the system doesn't actually do.
- **Negative reviews** mentioning unmet expectations.

Each pattern points to a divergence between user model and system reality. The fix depends on which side to change.

## Three fix strategies

### 1. Change the system

If the user's model is reasonable and many users share it, change the system to match. Often this is also the simpler design.

Example: users expect "save" to commit immediately. If your system actually queues the save for later, either make save immediate or rename the action to reflect the actual behavior.

### 2. Teach the model

If the system's behavior is genuinely better and users can learn it, invest in onboarding.

Examples:
- Anti-lock brakes required teaching: "brake firmly, steer; don't pump." Manufacturer campaigns and driver-ed material taught the new model.
- Spreadsheets taught a new computing model in the early 1980s; once learned, transferable.
- Modal editors (vim) require learning that "modes" exist; users who learn become extremely productive.

Onboarding that teaches a model:
- **Walks the user through** the first task with explicit guidance.
- **Provides explanation in context** — not a separate tutorial page.
- **Shows the system's state** as actions happen, so the user observes the model.
- **Uses progressive disclosure** of complexity over time.

### 3. Surface the divergence

When the system genuinely differs and you can't (or shouldn't) change the system, surface the difference at the moment it matters.

Examples:
- A "soft-deleted" item shows "Deleted (recoverable for 30 days)" — surfaces the system's actual model.
- A subscription cancellation shows "Canceled — access continues until [date]" — surfaces what canceled actually means.
- A search that ranks by relevance (not chronologically) shows "Sorted by relevance" — explains the unexpected order.

The point is to expose the divergence at the moment of the action, not buried in documentation.

## Onboarding patterns that teach mental models

### Guided first task

Walk the user through their first concrete task — not "here's a tour" but "let's create your first project."

```html
<aside class="onboarding-guide">
  <h3>Let's create your first project</h3>
  <p>1. Click the + button at the top right →</p>
  <!-- The new-project button is highlighted; the user clicks; next step appears -->
</aside>
```

Active practice teaches the interaction model better than passive watching.

### Inline explanation at the moment of action

When the user encounters a feature whose model differs from common expectations, explain in line:

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="visibility">Project visibility</label>
  <select id="visibility">
    <option value="private">Private (default)</option>
    <option value="team">Team</option>
    <option value="public">Public</option>
  </select>
  <p class="hint">
    Private = only you. Team = everyone in your workspace. Public = anyone with the link.
  </p>
</div>
```

The explanation prevents knowledge mistakes by surfacing the actual model.

### Progressive complexity

Don't expose every feature on day one. Reveal them as the user encounters surfaces where they apply. The user's interaction model grows with their need.

### "What's new" surfaces

When you ship a feature whose model users wouldn't predict from prior versions, announce explicitly. A "what's new in v2" panel that explains how the new feature works, with brief examples, prevents widespread misunderstanding.

## Anti-patterns

- **Tour-only onboarding.** Walk the user through a passive demo. They forget within hours; their interaction model isn't reinforced.
- **Documentation-as-onboarding.** "If you have questions, see the help center." Most users don't.
- **Hidden divergences.** A system that differs from expectation but doesn't say so. Users assume; produce errors.
- **Over-explanation in normal flows.** If you have to constantly explain how things work, the design isn't matching mental models well; redesign rather than over-tutorialize.

## Heuristics

1. **The "first surprise" diagnostic.** Watch a new user. Where do they say "huh, that's not what I expected"? Each surprise is a mental-model mismatch — fix the system or the surfaced model.
2. **The support-ticket pattern audit.** Cluster recent support tickets by the misunderstanding behind them. Patterns reveal mismatches.
3. **The cancel-rate signal.** Steps with high cancel rates often mean users reached them with the wrong expectation. Investigate.
