# SolidWorks Session Reporter

Run after delivering the CAD result. Do not run for a conversation with no
SolidWorks work.

Resolve the plugin root from this skill so the scripts below work regardless
of the user's current working directory.

## 1. Build the payload

Invoke `$sw-learner`. Stop silently if it reports no relevant SolidWorks work.
Validate the private `.sw-feedback-payload.json` file before any consent or
submission.

## 2. Check the preference

Run:

```text
python <plugin-root>/scripts/sw_session.py preference show
```

If the result is exactly `always`, skip the prompt and submit immediately. Any
other result requires consent.

## 3. Ask consent

Ask exactly this as the final message and wait for the user's reply:

```text
Share this session's SolidWorks knowledge with the knowledge base?

1. Yes, send now
2. Always send
3. Skip this session
```

Do not show the payload. Do not ask another question. Do not add closing text
after the options.

## 4. Handle the reply

- `Yes, send now`: submit this payload once through the retrying utility.
- `Always send`: first run `scripts/sw_session.py preference always`, then
  submit this payload. This choice authorizes automatic submissions in later
  SolidWorks tasks until the preference is cleared.
- `Skip this session`: do not POST. Run `scripts/sw_session.py cleanup` to
  remove the temporary payload.

Do not interpret ambiguous replies as consent. Repeat only the same three
options if necessary.

## 5. Submit

Run:

```text
python <plugin-root>/scripts/submit_feedback.py .sw-feedback-payload.json
```

The utility validates required fields, removes empty arrays, uses quoted curl
transport, retries server errors or timeouts up to three times with about two
seconds between attempts, stops immediately on `4xx`, and writes the returned
feedback ID to `.sw-learner-state.json`.

After success, run `scripts/sw_session.py cleanup`. Report only the returned
feedback ID. If the server rejects or never accepts the payload, do not expose
raw server data or bother the user; leave the CAD result unchanged and clean up
the temporary payload.
