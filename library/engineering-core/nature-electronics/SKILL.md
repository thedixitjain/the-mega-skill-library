# Nature Electronics (nature-electronics)

## Journal positioning

Nature Electronics is the Nature Portfolio journal covering the science and
engineering of electronics — from materials-level device physics through circuits to
integrated systems and their applications. It selects for **broad significance and a
field-advancing result** framed in the Nature style: a conceptual breakthrough, a new
device or material with a clear performance or functional leap, or a system that
demonstrates a genuinely new capability. An incremental device that improves a metric
without a conceptual or capability advance, or a process tweak with no broader
consequence, is a poor fit. This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing**
tool. It does not replace the journal's current official author guidelines. Before
submitting, re-check the live Nature Electronics submission guidelines on the Nature
Portfolio site.

## When to trigger

- The author names Nature Electronics for an electronic-devices, circuits, or systems
  result and wants a fit/framing and significance check.
- A device or systems result must be re-framed from a metric-improvement report into a
  Nature-style, field-advancing significance narrative.
- The author is choosing between Nature Electronics and `nature-materials` /
  `nature-communications`, or an IEEE device/circuits transactions venue.
- The author needs Nature Electronics' significance bar and its desk-reject heuristics.

## Scope & topic fit

- Device physics and emerging devices: transistors, memristors, 2D-material and
  organic/flexible electronics, spintronic and neuromorphic devices, when a new
  mechanism or capability is shown.
- Integrated circuits and computing hardware: low-power, in-memory, analog, and
  domain-specific architectures with a demonstrated, broadly significant advance.
- Sensors, flexible/wearable and bioelectronic systems where a new device concept
  enables a capability not previously achievable.
- Power, RF, photonic-electronic, and quantum-electronic devices and systems with a
  field-moving result rather than parameter optimization.
- Fabrication and integration advances (heterogeneous integration, new process
  schemes) when they unlock new device or system function, not just yield.
- System-level demonstrations that bridge from device physics to a working integrated
  capability with measured performance.

## Method & evidence bar

- The contribution must carry an explicit **significance argument**: what is
  conceptually or functionally new and why it advances electronics broadly.
- Device and system metrics must be quantitative and rigorously measured: report
  conditions, statistics across multiple devices, variability/yield where relevant, and
  uncertainty — not a single best-device datapoint.
- Performance and capability claims must be benchmarked against the current state of the
  art under comparable, clearly stated conditions.
- Reliability, stability, and scalability/manufacturability should be addressed honestly
  where they bear on the claimed advance, not deferred entirely.
- Theory, modeling, and simulation must be tied to measured devices or make tested
  predictions; simulation-only device claims rarely clear the bar.
- Reproducibility and reporting follow Nature-Portfolio expectations: methods, data
  availability, and statistics sufficient to reproduce key results.

## Structure & house style

- Nature-Portfolio article structure with a significance-forward abstract and
  introduction; re-check current article types and length/format on the live guide.
- The introduction establishes the broad-significance gap and the stakes for
  electronics before the technical development, in accessible language.
- Main display items are curated and load-bearing: device characteristics with
  statistics, benchmark comparisons, and clear schematics of the device/system concept.
- Methods and extended/supplementary material carry full fabrication, measurement, and
  device-statistics detail; the main narrative must stand on the headline figures.
- Multi-device statistics and variability data are expected in support, not optional
  afterthoughts.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and
  `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the Nature-Portfolio anchors,
  then cite the current Nature Electronics guidelines page you checked.
- Search the live site for "Nature Electronics submission guidelines" and follow the
  current Nature-Portfolio submission system.
- Re-check article types (Article, Letter/short formats), length/format expectations,
  and the abstract requirements.
- Confirm data-availability, code-availability, and reporting-summary requirements of
  Nature Portfolio.
- Re-check open-access options, ORCID, competing-interests, funding,
  author-contribution, and AI-use disclosure requirements.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions
  win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] The abstract/introduction states the broad significance and the field-advancing claim in Nature style.
- [ ] The advance is conceptual or capability-level, not an incremental metric improvement.
- [ ] Device/system metrics include multi-device statistics, variability, and uncertainty — not a single best device.
- [ ] Performance is benchmarked against the state of the art under comparable conditions.
- [ ] Reliability/scalability/manufacturability are addressed where they bear on the claim.
- [ ] Any theory/simulation is anchored to measured devices or makes a tested prediction.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Incremental device with a metric improvement but no conceptual or capability leap.
- Single best-device result with no multi-device statistics or variability data.
- Performance claims not benchmarked, or compared to a weak/non-comparable reference.
- Process or fabrication tweak with improved yield but no new device/system function.
- Simulation-only device claim with no fabricated, measured device.
- Specialty-scoped engineering result better suited to a focused device/circuits journal.

## Re-routing decision

- Advance driven primarily by a new electronic material → `nature-materials` / `advanced-materials`.
- Broad cross-disciplinary significance beyond electronics → `nature-communications` / `science-advances`.
- Photonic-electronic or integrated-photonics emphasis → `nature-photonics` / `light-science-and-applications` / `optica`.
- Specialty device, circuit, or process result → an IEEE device/circuits/electron-devices transactions venue.
- Bioelectronic system with biomedical significance and validation → `nature-biomedical-engineering`.

[Method/evidence] <do device/system metrics + statistics + benchmarking clear the significance + rigor bar?>
[Top risk] <the single most likely reason for rejection>
[Official items to re-check] <article type / data & code availability / reporting summary / OA / disclosures>
[Re-route suggestion] <if incremental or better framed elsewhere, a matched venue>
