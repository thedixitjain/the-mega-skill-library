    sections: [event_format, subscription_model]
    why: "New event-driven communication pattern"
```

#### Data Storage Changes

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are database schema changes needed? If yes, specify tables, columns, and relationships. If no, remove this section]
```yaml
# Database/storage schema modifications
Table: primary_entity_table
  ADD COLUMN: new_field (data_type, constraints)
  MODIFY COLUMN: existing_field (new_constraints)

```

### MECE Check: Interfaces & Data Models
- [ ] No two interfaces serve the same consumer-to-provider path (no overlap)
- [ ] All component-to-component and component-to-external communication paths are documented (no gaps)
- [ ] Each data entity owns a distinct slice of the domain (no duplicate business data across entities)
- [ ] All data referenced in interfaces and acceptance criteria is modeled in an entity

### Implementation Examples

**Purpose**: Provide strategic code examples to clarify complex logic, critical algorithms, or integration patterns. These examples are for guidance, not prescriptive implementation.

**Include examples for**:
- Complex business logic that needs clarification
- Critical algorithms or calculations
- Non-obvious integration patterns
- Security-sensitive implementations
- Performance-critical sections

**When examples include raw SQL or direct database access**:

1. **Schema Reference** — List actual column names for every table in the query. Point to the migration file as source of truth. Call out columns that DON'T exist (common: pseudocode names like `status` for date-computed fields, `code` on junction tables where it lives on a catalog table, `period_start` when only a timestamp like `settled_at` exists).

2. **Traced Walkthrough** — For queries with conditional logic, show example rows and trace how the condition evaluates for each variant. Include concrete numbers. The reader should understand *why* the query produces different results for different inputs without having to mentally execute the SQL.

3. **Edge Cases** — Document what happens when the query returns no rows, NULL values, or zero. Map each case to the Python/TypeScript code path that handles it.

**Why this matters**: Pseudocode column names in SQL examples look plausible but cause immediate implementation failures. A new session cannot verify column names from the SDD alone — it must cross-reference migration files. Including the schema reference eliminates this round-trip and prevents wrong-column bugs.

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there complex areas that would benefit from code examples? If not, remove this section]

#### Example: [Complex Business Logic Name]

**Why this example**: [Explain why this specific example helps clarify the implementation]

```typescript
// Example: Discount calculation with multiple rules
// This demonstrates the expected logic flow, not the exact implementation
function calculateDiscount(order: Order, user: User): Discount {
  // Business rule: VIP users get additional benefits
  const baseDiscount = order.subtotal * getBaseDiscountRate(user.tier);

  // Complex rule: Stacking discounts with limits
  const promotionalDiscount = Math.min(
    order.promotions.reduce((sum, promo) => sum + promo.value, 0),
    order.subtotal * MAX_PROMO_PERCENTAGE
  );

  // Edge case: Never exceed maximum discount
  return Math.min(
    baseDiscount + promotionalDiscount,
    order.subtotal * MAX_TOTAL_DISCOUNT
  );
}
```

#### Example: [Integration Pattern Name]

**Why this example**: [Explain why this pattern is important to document]

```python
# Example: Retry pattern for external service integration
# Shows expected error handling approach
async def call_payment_service(transaction):
    """
    Demonstrates resilient integration pattern.
    Actual implementation may use circuit breaker library.
    """
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
        try:
            response = await payment_client.process(transaction)
            if response.requires_3ds:
                # Critical: Handle 3D Secure flow
                return await handle_3ds_flow(response)
            return response
        except TransientError as e:
            if attempt == MAX_RETRIES - 1:
                # Final attempt failed, escalate
                raise PaymentServiceUnavailable(e)
            await exponential_backoff(attempt)
        except PermanentError as e:
            # Don't retry permanent failures
            raise PaymentFailed(e)
```

#### Test Examples as Interface Documentation

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can unit tests serve as interface documentation?]

```javascript
// Example: Unit test as interface contract
describe('PromoCodeValidator', () => {
  it('should validate promo code format and availability', async () => {
    // This test documents expected interface behavior
    const validator = new PromoCodeValidator(mockRepository);

    // Valid code passes all checks
    const validResult = await validator.validate('SUMMER2024');
    expect(validResult).toEqual({
      valid: true,
      discount: { type: 'percentage', value: 20 },
      restrictions: { minOrder: 50, maxUses: 1 }
    });

    // Expired code returns specific error
    const expiredResult = await validator.validate('EXPIRED2023');
    expect(expiredResult).toEqual({
      valid: false,
      error: 'PROMO_EXPIRED',
      message: 'This promotional code has expired'
    });
  });
});
```

- Reliability: [Uptime targets, error recovery, data integrity]

## Acceptance Criteria

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What system behaviors verify the PRD acceptance scenarios are met?]

Translate each critical PRD acceptance scenario into a system-level specification using EARS format. These criteria define the technical "done" for implementation.

Use the appropriate EARS pattern for each criterion:
- **UBIQUITOUS**: `THE SYSTEM SHALL [action]` - always-on behavior
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: `WHEN [trigger], THE SYSTEM SHALL [action]` - user/system events
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: `WHILE [state], THE SYSTEM SHALL [action]` - mode-dependent
- **OPTIONAL**: `WHERE [feature enabled], THE SYSTEM SHALL [action]` - configurable
- **COMPLEX**: `IF [condition], THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [action]` - business rules

**Main Flow Criteria: [PRD/AC-X.Y - Brief description]**
- [ ] WHEN [user/system trigger], THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected behavior]
- [ ] THE SYSTEM SHALL [always-on requirement]

**Error Handling Criteria: [PRD/AC-X.Y - Error handling]**
- [ ] WHEN [error condition occurs], THE SYSTEM SHALL [graceful handling]
- [ ] IF [invalid input], THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [appropriate feedback]

**Edge Case Criteria: [PRD/AC-X.Y - Edge case]**
- [ ] WHILE [boundary state], THE SYSTEM SHALL [correct behavior]
- [ ] IF [limit condition], THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [appropriate response]

### MECE Check: Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each EARS criterion specifies a unique system behavior (no two criteria verify the same thing)
- [ ] Every PRD acceptance criterion has a corresponding EARS criterion (no gaps)
- [ ] Criteria collectively cover happy path, error handling, and edge cases for every component
