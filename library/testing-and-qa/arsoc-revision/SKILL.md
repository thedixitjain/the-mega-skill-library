# Revision & Response for a Review (arsoc-revision)

## When to trigger

- A Committee/referee letter on the invited review arrived
- Referees flagged missing literatures, imbalance, mischaracterization, method-siloing, or "reads like a list"
- The editor asked to expand, cut, or rebalance coverage, or to make the framework explicit
- You need a point-by-point response for a review article, not a primary paper

## Categories of review feedback (and how to answer each)

ARSoc revision asks cluster differently from primary-research asks. Triage every point into one bucket:

| Feedback type | Typical phrasing | Response move |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Coverage gap** | "you omit the X literature / author Y / the qualitative work" | almost always *concede and integrate* — place the missing work in the right framework cell; re-run saturation (`arsoc-literature-synthesis`) and update the coverage account |
| **Balance / fairness** | "this slights school Z / over-cites the author / dismisses method M" | steelman the slighted side; re-audit self-citation and method balance (`arsoc-comprehensiveness-and-balance`) |
| **Appraisal accuracy** | "you mischaracterize study W" | correct precisely; reviewed authors often referee — fix exactly |
| **Framework / structure** | "this is an annotated bibliography" | strengthen or make explicit the spine (`arsoc-organizing-framework`); do not just reorder paragraphs |
| **Accessibility** | "a sociologist outside the subfield can't follow Section 4" | add intuition, define jargon (`arsoc-writing-style`) |
| **Scope** | "too broad / too narrow / overruns length" | negotiate with the editor (`arsoc-editor-strategy`); rescope deliberately, within the envelope |
| **Transparency** | "how did you decide what to include?" | document/expand the coverage account (`arsoc-transparency-and-reproducibility`) |

## ARSoc-specific revision ledger

Annual Review of Sociology revisions should make the sociology of the review visible: which
subfields, methods, theoretical traditions, and evidentiary communities are being asked to recognize
the synthesis as fair. Keep a ledger that distinguishes "we added citations" from "we repaired the
review's sociological coverage contract."

| Revision pressure | Evidence to add or rebalance | Where it should show up |
|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Subfield omission | missing conversation, classic line, or contemporary debate | coverage account plus framework cell |
| Method-siloing | qualitative, quantitative, comparative-historical, computational, or mixed-method evidence | method-balance table and synthesis text |
| Theory lineage dispute | genealogy of concepts, schools, and critiques | theory map, not only parenthetical citations |
| Positionality / power concern | whose standpoint, institution, or case is centered | appraisal paragraphs and limitations |
| Cross-subfield accessibility | translation of terms across adjacent sociological audiences | section openings and bridge sentences |
| Inclusion-rule opacity | search terms, boundary decisions, and excluded literatures | transparent coverage account |

Use this ledger before drafting the letter; it keeps the reply from sounding like a generic Annual
Review response and shows that the revised article can travel across sociology's internal audiences.

## Writing the response letter

- **Point-by-point, quote-then-respond.** Reproduce each comment, then state the change and where it lives (section/page/table).
- **Coverage asks: concede and integrate.** A missing literature is a real defect in a review of record; adding it strengthens the article. Resist defensiveness — the omitting author may be the referee who named it.
- **Balance asks: show the steelman.** Demonstrate the revised text states the other side at its strongest; that is what a fairness complaint actually demands. If a *method* was slighted, show it is now weighed on its own terms.
- **Accuracy asks: fix exactly.** Mischaracterizing a reviewed author who is your referee is the fastest route to a hostile second round; correct the wording precisely and, where helpful, quote their own framing.
- **Make method pluralism concrete.** Acknowledge what each evidence mode can and cannot show instead
  of ranking methods implicitly by citation count or table space.
- **Repair the coverage account when the draft changes.** New literatures can alter the logic of
  inclusion, so update the account rather than treating transparency as a static appendix.
- **Disagree rarely and respectfully.** If an ask would break the spine or overrun the envelope, explain the trade-off and propose an alternative, ideally pre-cleared with the editor.
- **Keep the editor central.** On scope and conflicting referee asks, ask the Committee editor to adjudicate rather than satisfying mutually-incompatible referees.
- **Track every addition's ripple.** Adding a literature can shift the review's center of gravity; after each integration, re-check that the framework cells, the summary tables, the balance audit, and the coverage account still hold, and that the draft still fits the volume's length envelope.
- **Mind the volume clock.** Revisions run against a production deadline (`arsoc-editor-strategy`); plan the rework so the article stays in its volume.

## Checklist

- [ ] Every comment triaged into a bucket (coverage / balance / appraisal / framework / accessibility / scope / transparency)
- [ ] Coverage gaps conceded and integrated into the right framework cell; saturation + coverage account re-run
- [ ] Balance complaints answered by demonstrable steelmanning + self-citation and method-balance re-audit
- [ ] Mischaracterizations corrected precisely (reviewed authors may be the referees)
- [ ] "Annotated bibliography" asks answered by a stronger/explicit spine, not reordering
- [ ] Subfield, method, theory-lineage, power/positionality, and inclusion-rule concerns logged separately
- [ ] Accessibility fixes add intuition / define jargon for the cross-subfield reader
- [ ] Scope conflicts routed to the editor; rework fits the envelope and the volume deadline
- [ ] Point-by-point letter: quote-then-respond, with section/page/table locations
- [ ] Comprehensiveness + balance + coverage account re-audited after all additions

## Anti-patterns

- Defending an omission rather than adding the missing literature (a review gap is a real defect)
- Answering a balance complaint with assertions of fairness instead of revised, steelmanned text
- Dismissing or re-mischaracterizing a reviewed author who is likely your referee
- "Fixing" an annotated-bibliography critique by shuffling paragraphs without imposing a spine
- Letting method balance mean "one paragraph per method" rather than a real account of evidentiary limits
- Updating citations while leaving the inclusion rule or theory lineage unexplained
- Bloating scope to satisfy every "also cover…" until the review overruns its length and slips the volume
- Trying to satisfy two contradictory referees instead of asking the editor to decide

## Output format

```text
【Triage】each comment bucketed (coverage/balance/appraisal/framework/accessibility/scope/transparency)? Y/N
【Coverage gaps】conceded + integrated into framework cells; saturation + account re-run? Y/N
【Balance】steelman shown in revised text; self-citation + method balance re-audited? Y/N
【Appraisal fixes】mischaracterizations corrected precisely? Y/N
【Framework asks】spine strengthened/made explicit (not reordered)? Y/N
【Sociology ledger】subfield/method/theory/power/inclusion-rule concerns separated? Y/N
【Scope/length】fits envelope + volume deadline? Y/N
【Letter】point-by-point, quote-then-respond, with locations? Y/N
【Next step】→ arsoc-submission (re-deliver the revised review)
```
