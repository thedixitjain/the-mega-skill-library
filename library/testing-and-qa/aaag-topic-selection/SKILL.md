# Topic Selection & Area Fit (aaag-topic-selection)

The Annals is the AAG's **broad four-area flagship**. A topic earns a place by being *geographic* —
space, place, scale, region, or spatial process is constitutive of the question — and by speaking to
one of the journal's areas with enough reach that geographers outside that subfield see why it matters.

## When to trigger

- Choosing a project, or deciding if a draft fits the Annals vs. a specialty venue
- A reviewer or colleague said "this isn't really geography" or "this is too narrow"
- Unsure whether to declare Geographic Methods, Human, Nature-Society, Physical, or General Geography

## The two-part fit test

1. **Geographic-ness.** Could you delete every spatial/place/scale element and keep the argument? If
   yes, it is not yet a geography paper — the geography must do theoretical work, not just locate data.
2. **Area reach.** Within the declared area, would a geographer in a *neighboring* subfield see the
   stake? An over-narrow result that only its sub-sub-field cares about is an Annals off-fit.

## Declare the area (it routes the paper and sets the bar)

| Area | Core of a strong topic | Off-fit signal |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Geographic Methods** | a method/model that improves geographic *inference* (spatial dependence, scale, MAUP, uncertainty) | a generic ML/stats trick with a coordinate column bolted on |
| **Human Geography** | a spatially/relationally theorized account of social process | a sociology/anthropology paper with a study-area map |
| **Nature and Society** | a coupled human-environment dynamic where both sides are theorized | one side asserted as backdrop to the other |
| **Physical Geography, Earth & Environmental** | an earth-surface/environmental process with geographic framing and earth-science rigor | a lab/RS result with no geographic question |
| **General Geography** | a contribution that reorders how *all* geographers see something | a paper that just won't pick an area |

## Calibrating ambition (Annals vs. specialty venue)

- **Specialty venue** (e.g., *IJGIS*, *Geomorphology*, *Environment and Planning D*) when the audience
  is the sub-field and the advance is incremental within it.
- **The Annals** when the contribution is legible to the area broadly and connects to geographic theory
  or to a cross-cutting concern (scale, place, environment-society, spatial method).
- **The cross-disciplinary/General track** when the contribution genuinely spans areas.

## Sibling-journal guard (do not mis-pitch)

- **Progress in Human Geography** — review/agenda essays, not original empirical studies.
- **Geographical Analysis** — formal spatial-analytic methods; the Annals Methods area is broader and more applied.
- **Transactions of the IBG / The Professional Geographer** — overlapping scope; the Annals is the AAG's broad flagship with the four-area structure.

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A draft asks "what predicts urban tree-canopy loss in City X?" and maps the result by census tract.

```
Delete-test: remove the map and "tract" → "what predicts canopy loss?" survives → geography decorative
Repair: reframe around SCALE — does the predictor of loss change with the unit/scale of analysis, and
  what does that imply for where canopy is added? Now space is the argument, not the backdrop.
Area: Nature and Society (canopy = environment-society) or Methods (if the scale claim leads)
Reach: a methods reader gets a MAUP/scale lesson; a nature-society reader gets an equity mechanism
```

The repaired version makes the geography load-bearing and gives a neighboring subfield a reason to read.

## Checklist

- [ ] The geography is load-bearing (delete-test passes)
- [ ] One area declared, with a one-line reason it belongs there
- [ ] A neighboring-subfield geographer can state the stake in a sentence
- [ ] Right venue confirmed (Annals vs. a specialty journal)
- [ ] Article type chosen (Article / Forum / Commentary) — see `aaag-workflow`

## Anti-patterns

- "Spatial decoration" — coordinates or a study-area map standing in for a geographic argument
- Pitching a specialty-venue increment to the broad flagship
- Refusing to pick an area (the paper lands with the wrong editor and reviewers)
- A Nature-Society topic that theorizes only the social or only the biophysical side

## Output format

```
【Area】Methods / Human / Nature-Society / Physical / General
【Geographic core】the space/place/scale/process the argument turns on
【Reach】why a neighboring-subfield geographer cares
【Venue check】Annals vs. specialty (one line)
【Type】Article / Forum / Commentary
【Next】aaag-literature-positioning
```
