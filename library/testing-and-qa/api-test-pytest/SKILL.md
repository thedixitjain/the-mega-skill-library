## When to Use

- Need API outputs that should land in pytest-based automation.
- The project is already Python-first or wants pytest-style structure.

## Output Format Options

Markdown by default unless the request explicitly asks for another format.

## How to Use

1. Open `prompts/api-test-pytest.md` and use it as the main prompt.
2. Add the real project context: scope, environment, constraints, risks, dependencies, and expected deliverable.
3. If the input is incomplete, return a usable first version and mark missing information and assumptions.

## Reference Files

- `prompts/api-test-pytest.md`: main prompt for this skill.
- `references/`: supporting notes loaded only when needed.
- `examples/`: sample inputs or outputs.
- `scripts/`: helper scripts or converters for this skill.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not use it with vague scope and no context.
- Do not treat every area as equally important.
- Do not skip assumptions and missing information.

## Best Practices

- Start from the prompt file, then add only the context that matters.
- Keep the output risk-driven and executable.
- If the request is incomplete, return a usable first version and mark gaps.
