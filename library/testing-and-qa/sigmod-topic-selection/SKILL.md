# SIGMOD Topic Selection

SIGMOD's research track wants contributions *to* data management — storage,
query processing, transactions, data integration, systems for and with ML,
data engineering at scale — where the advance would matter to someone
building or theorizing a data system. The commonest misroute is the
application paper that uses databases heavily but advances only its
application. Run the fit test before any writing investment.

## The core fit question

State the contribution in one sentence and inspect the direct object. "We
make **query optimization** better under X" is SIGMOD-shaped. "We make
**fraud detection** better using a database" is not, unless the fraud
workload forced a reusable data-management technique — in which case *that
technique* is the paper.

## Neighbor-venue decision table

| Signal in the project | Better home | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Data-management advance, evaluation ready now | SIGMOD round or PVLDB | Pick by calendar and model, below |
| Formal semantics, complexity, lower bounds | PODS | Co-located theory sibling with its own PC |
| Mining/ML method where data infra is incidental | KDD or an ML venue | SIGMOD PCs route these out fast |
| Provocative architecture vision, thin evaluation | CIDR | Evidence bar differs by design |
| Deployed-system experience, lessons, scale war stories | SIGMOD industrial track | Needs ≥1 non-academic author; separate CFP |
| Mature line needing definitive long-form treatment | TODS | Journal pace; also invites best SIGMOD papers |
| Broad data-engineering result, DB framing weak | ICDE | Same community, different flagship |

## SIGMOD vs. PVLDB: same field, different machinery

The two flagships overlap almost completely in scope; the choice is
mechanical, and worth making deliberately:

- **Cadence:** SIGMOD batches quarterly rounds into PACMMOD issues; PVLDB
  accepts monthly on a rolling basis into the year's volume.
- **Failure cost:** a SIGMOD rejection locks the track for 12 months; PVLDB's
  monthly gate makes retry geometry different — check its current
  resubmission rules rather than assuming symmetry.
- **Revision shape:** both use journal-style revisions now; the calendars
  and letter mechanics differ by cycle.
- **Practical rule:** with a result ready in week X, compute time-to-first-
  verdict at each venue's next gate and weigh it against where the work's
  nearest neighbors have been landing recently.

## Research vs. industrial track

If the contribution's strength is *that it runs in production* — scale,
operational lessons, design retrospectives of a shipped engine — the
industrial track evaluates it on those terms, while the research track would
demand novelty the deployment story may not carry. Requirements differ
(non-academic co-author, separate deadline calendar, own PC), and the SIGMOD
2027 industrial CFP was not yet posted as of 2026-07-08 — verify before
planning around it.

## Fit-sharpening moves

- Name the data-management primitive touched: an index, an optimizer rule,
  a consistency protocol, a storage layout, a data-cleaning operator. No
  primitive, no research-track paper.
- Check the current CFP's topics list; scope wording shifts by cycle, and
  ML-for-systems / systems-for-ML emphasis has been growing.
- Probe generality: does the technique survive outside your prototype?
  A PC of engine builders will ask "would this help Postgres/RocksDB/
  Spark," concretely.
- Read the last two PACMMOD issues in your area; if nothing there shares
  your problem statement, either you found a gap or you found a fit
  problem — decide which with evidence.

## Reading the venue's current appetite

Beyond the CFP's topic list, three observable signals calibrate fit:

- Scan the most recent PACMMOD issue's table of contents: the distribution
  of storage vs. query vs. ML-adjacent vs. data-integration papers is the
  revealed preference of the current PC structure.
- Award choices telegraph values — the Test-of-Time lineage (see
  `resources/exemplars/library.md`) consistently honors work that changed
  what systems *do*, not what benchmarks report.
- Keynote and tutorial themes at the last edition mark where the community
  believes its frontier is; a paper swimming with that current gets read
  more generously than the CFP text alone predicts.

```text
Quick probe: title your paper, then find five PACMMOD/PVLDB papers from
the last two years that would cite it. Cannot name five -> the fit
problem is upstream of the writing.
```

## One project, routed three ways

A fictional team builds learned cardinality estimation into a production
cloud optimizer. Three legitimate papers hide inside: the estimation
technique with guarantees and controlled evaluation (SIGMOD research or
PVLDB); the deployment retrospective with fleet-scale lessons (SIGMOD
industrial); the formal analysis of when learned estimators can beat
histograms (PODS). Shipping all three as one manuscript serves none of the
three PCs — and PACMMOD's overlap rule means the split must be genuine, with
disjoint results.

## Output format

```text
[Fit verdict] research track / industrial track / neighbor venue
[Primitive] the data-management object the paper advances
[One-sentence claim] with the direct object underlined
[Venue race] time-to-verdict SIGMOD round vs. PVLDB gate
[Split risk] salami-slicing vs. legitimate multi-paper plan
[Next step] write / re-scope / re-route, with rationale
```
