# ICDE Topic Selection

Use this before writing. ICDE is strongest for **data engineering** — the design, building,
management, and evaluation of data-intensive systems — where the contribution is a
reconstructable data-management primitive with a systems-grade evaluation.

## The data-management-primitive test

Ask what primitive the paper advances: an **access method**, a **query operator**, an
**execution or storage mechanism**, a **transaction or concurrency protocol**, a **data
integration/cleaning/provenance technique**, or a **scalable analytics engine**. If no
primitive exists — if the database is merely a container for a result that lives elsewhere —
the ICDE framing does not exist either.

## Routing from ICDE's seat: the three-venue triangle

The scopes of ICDE, SIGMOD, and VLDB overlap almost entirely, so routing is usually about
**calendar geometry and house culture**, not topic. Deciding from ICDE's seat:

| If the deciding factor is... | Lean toward | Because |
|---|---|---|
| You want two fixed shots a year and IEEE-Xplore proceedings | **ICDE** | Two rounds per edition (≈June + November), single-blind, IEEE format |
| You want quarterly journal-style rounds with a formal revision and a rejection embargo | **SIGMOD / PACMMOD** | Four rounds on the 17th, double-anonymous, 12-month embargo |
| You want to pick any month and submit on a rolling calendar | **VLDB / PVLDB** | Twelve monthly deadlines on the 1st, single-blind, revise verdict |
| The work is a shipped production system with deployment evidence | **ICDE industry track** (or SIGMOD industrial) | Non-academic co-author, production-scale story |
| The work needs journal-length treatment | **IEEE TKDE** or **The VLDB Journal** | Full-length exposition; ICDE best papers are invited to extend into TKDE anyway |
| The work is European-database-community facing | **EDBT** | Overlapping scope, different community and calendar |

## Fit signal table

| Signal in the project | ICDE reading |
|---|---|
| A new index, operator, or storage layout with a systems evaluation | Core fit — the house genre |
| A concurrency/transaction protocol exploiting new hardware | Core fit (cf. the Bw-Tree exemplar) |
| A platform primitive an ecosystem can build on | Core fit (cf. the SpatialHadoop exemplar) |
| A production cloud-database architecture with deployment lessons | Industry and applications track |
| An ML model that happens to run on data | Route to an ML venue unless the DB primitive is the contribution |
| A pure theory result with no system or workload | Route to a theory or journal venue |

## Sharpening moves before committing

- **Name the primitive in one sentence.** "We make ordering a read-time cost so ingestion is
  write-bandwidth-bound" is a primitive; "we improve time-series databases" is a topic.
- **Check the round you can actually hit.** Because a Round 1 reject skips you to the next
  edition, do not aim a half-built system at Round 1 just because it is sooner.
- **Decide research vs. industry honestly.** If the evidence is production scale and the
  novelty is engineering-at-scale rather than a new mechanism, the industry track fits better
  and reviews you on the right axis.
- Topic emphasis and track boundaries drift between editions; scan the current call's topic
  list before final routing.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] strong ICDE / possible ICDE / better elsewhere
[Primitive] <one-sentence data-management primitive, or "none">
[Best venue] ICDE-research / ICDE-industry / SIGMOD / PVLDB / TKDE / EDBT / other
[Round target] Round 1 or Round 2 of which edition, if ICDE
[Top rejection risk] <novelty / evaluation / scope / wrong-track>
[Next action] <build, measure, reframe, or venue switch>
```
