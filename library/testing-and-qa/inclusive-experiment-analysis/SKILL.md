Use when checking whether an experiment benefits or harms different user groups, planning segmentation dimensions, auditing test/control balance, interpreting subgroup effects, or reviewing product changes for inclusive experimentation."

# Inclusive Experiment Analysis

Use this skill to make sure experiment design and readouts consider the range
of users affected by a product change. It focuses on subgroup impact,
accessibility, representation, data dimensions, and unintended harm.

## Source Traceability

Primary source: Practical A/B Testing by Leemay Nassery. Guidance is
transformed and paraphrased from chapter 1 lines 719-912 and related subgroup
analysis context from lines 639-718. Metric and eligibility context comes from
chapter 2 lines 1564-1735.

## Related Advanced Skills

- `trustworthy-experiment-insights`: use when subgroup findings may be
  underpowered, false positives, or false negatives.
- `experiment-verification-monitoring`: use when inclusion risks depend on
  assignment, exposure, device, geography, accessibility, or segment monitoring.
- `adaptive-experimentation-strategy`: use cautiously when contextual bandits or
  personalization could create uneven user impact across groups.

## Reference Routing

| Need | Read |
|------|------|
| Inclusive experiment concepts | `references/core/knowledge.md` |
| Design and analysis rules | `references/core/rules.md` |
| Segment examples | `references/core/examples.md` |
| Review workflow | `workflows/review-inclusive-impact.md` |

## Workflow

1. Identify which user groups could experience the change differently.
2. Choose dimensions that are relevant, ethical, and available.
3. Check test/control balance for important dimensions when possible.
4. Include accessibility, bandwidth, device, privacy, geography, and usage-level
   concerns where relevant.
5. Analyze subgroup outcomes without cherry-picking.
6. Recommend launch, mitigation, follow-up testing, or deeper research.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Inclusive Experiment Review

## Change Under Review
[What is changing and who may be affected.]

## User Dimensions
| Dimension | Why It Matters | Data Available? | Use In Analysis? |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|

## Balance And Impact
| Segment | Control | Test | Result | Concern |
|---------|---------|------|--------|---------|

## Risks
- Accessibility:
- Device or bandwidth:
- Privacy or consent:
- Representation:
- Data limitations:

## Recommendation
[Ship | Ship with mitigation | Do not ship | Investigate] because [reason].
```

## Quality Bar

- Do not use sensitive attributes casually; explain why a dimension is needed.
- Do not claim inclusive impact when the data lacks relevant representation.
- Do not average away harm to a meaningful subgroup.
- Pair quantitative subgroup analysis with qualitative or accessibility review
  when metrics cannot capture the risk.
