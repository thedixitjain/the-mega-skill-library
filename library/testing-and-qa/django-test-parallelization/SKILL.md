# Django Test Parallelization

Parallel test execution is a multiplier after a suite is isolated. Treat failures under parallel execution as evidence of hidden shared state until proven otherwise.

## Readiness Workflow

1. Measure serial runtime first.
   - If the suite is already dominated by startup or database creation, parallelism may not help enough on its own.

2. Check isolation before enabling parallelism as the default.
   - Run in reverse order.
   - Run with randomized order when reverse order is not enough.
   - Preserve random seeds so failures can be reproduced.

3. Enable the runner deliberately.
   - Django runner: install `tblib`, then run `python manage.py test --parallel`.
   - pytest-django: install `pytest-xdist`, then run `pytest -n auto`.

4. Classify failures.
   - Order-dependent failures usually come from mutated globals, class attributes, settings, caches, monkeypatches, or database assumptions.
   - Parallel-only failures usually come from shared resources such as files, cache keys, ports, queues, external services, or temporary directories.

5. Make resources worker-safe.
   - Prefer sharding per process or worker.
   - Use locks only when the resource cannot be partitioned.
   - Keep lock scope narrow.

6. Balance work after it is correct.
   - Split large test classes or modules only when measurement shows one group holds back the parallel run.

## Commands

```bash
python -m pip install tblib
python manage.py test --parallel
python manage.py test --parallel 1
python manage.py test --reverse

python -m pip install pytest-xdist
pytest -n auto
pytest -n auto --dist loadscope
```

For shared-resource patterns, read [shared-resources.md](references/shared-resources.md).

## Decision Rules

- Add parallel testing early in new projects; older serial suites often have hidden isolation assumptions.
- Use CI reverse-order testing as a low-friction guard against order dependencies.
- Use random order when reverse order misses a suspected dependency, and capture the seed.
- Prefer `pytest -n auto --dist loadscope` for Django `TestCase`-heavy suites because class/module setup can be expensive.
- Shard resources before reaching for locks.
- Put process-specific behavior in test settings only, not production settings.
- Split large test groups only after profiling shows an imbalance.

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming database transaction isolation protects caches, files, task queues, or external systems.
- Mutating class attributes, globals, app settings, or cache entries without restoring them.
- Enabling random order without preserving the seed.
- Using a single lockfile for too much work and accidentally serializing the suite.
- Letting pytest-xdist split related tests so finely that setup cost is duplicated.
- Making parallelism the default before the suite passes reliably under order-isolation checks.

## Verification

Before calling parallelization complete:

- Serial run passes.
- Reverse or random-order run passes, or known failures are fixed.
- Parallel run passes at least twice.
- Any shared-resource sharding lives in test configuration.
- CI has a serial fallback command for debugging.
