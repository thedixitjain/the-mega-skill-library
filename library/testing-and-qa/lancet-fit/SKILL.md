# Scope & Significance Fit (lancet-fit)

## Why this is skill #1

The Lancet triages **most submissions to rejection without external review**. The gate is not "is the trial sound" — it is **"is this clinically or public-health important, globally relevant, and likely to change practice or policy."** A rigorous single-centre confirmatory study is rejected if it does not move practice for a broadly relevant problem. Run this before investing in prose.

## When to trigger

- Before drafting, to decide if The Lancet is even the right venue.
- When a co-investigator says "this is a Lancet paper" and you need a sober second opinion.
- When choosing among The Lancet, the Lancet family, NEJM/JAMA/BMJ, and a specialty journal.

## The Lancet bar (four lenses)

A strong Lancet paper usually scores on most of these:

1. **Clinical / public-health importance** — affects a common or high-burden condition, or a decision clinicians/policymakers actually face.
2. **Global relevance** — matters beyond a single high-income setting; ideally international or low/middle-income-country (LMIC) data, or a lesson that generalises globally.
3. **Practice- or policy-changing** — the result should alter a guideline, a treatment choice, or a public-health program — not merely add to the literature.
4. **Equity / advocacy angle** — The Lancet actively favours work on health inequity, marginalised populations, and the social/structural determinants of health.

## Significance ladder (weak → strong)

1. **Confirms** an established treatment effect in one centre. (Weak — specialty/family title.)
2. **Extends** a known effect to a new population or setting. (Borderline.)
3. **Resolves** a clinically important uncertainty a guideline panel is debating. (Strong.)
4. **Establishes** a new standard of care, or a public-health intervention that works at scale. (Strong.)
5. **Changes global policy** or overturns a widely used practice with decisive trial/observational evidence. (Strongest.)

If you cannot place the work at rung 3+, The Lancet is a long shot — name the realistic target.

## Fatal triage triggers

- **Narrow / local**: single-centre, small, high-income-only, no global lesson.
- **Incremental**: extends the authors' own prior trial without changing the decision.
- **Surrogate-only**: a surrogate endpoint with no clinical or policy consequence demonstrated.
- **Over-claiming**: causal or practice-changing language that outruns the design (a top rejection reason).
- **Underpowered** for the clinically meaningful effect, or analysis not pre-specified.

## Venue routing (within and beyond the Lancet family)

| Situation                                                            | Recommend                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rung 4–5, globally relevant, practice/policy-changing                | **The Lancet** (Article)           |
| Global-health / LMIC focus, strong but not top-tier general          | ***Lancet Global Health***         |
| Population/public-health intervention or surveillance                | ***Lancet Public Health***         |
| Specialty-defining clinical result                                   | **Lancet specialty title** (e.g. *Oncology*, *Respiratory*, *Neurology*) |
| Solid, rigorous, but not practice-changing for a broad audience      | ***EClinicalMedicine*** (open access) |
| Definitive RCT, possibly US-centric, no global/equity emphasis       | **NEJM / JAMA**                    |
| Generalist EBM / strong patient-partnership angle                    | **BMJ**                            |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative numbers — not real data)

Two hypothetical studies arriving at the same desk, to show how the fit gate sorts them.

```
Study A (illustrative): single-centre RCT, high-income city, n=180, surrogate endpoint
  improved (biomarker -0.4 SD, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.1). No global lesson, no policy hook.
  -> Lens scores: importance weak, global weak, policy weak, equity weak
  -> Significance rung 1 (confirms in one centre) -> NOT The Lancet; route to a specialty/family title.

Study B (illustrative): pragmatic cluster RCT across 3 LMICs, n=12 400 in 60 clusters,
  hard clinical outcome: mortality 4.1% vs 5.6% (absolute risk reduction 1.5 pp,
  95% CI 0.7-2.3; NNT ~67, illustrative), scalable low-cost intervention.
  -> Lens scores: importance strong, global strong, policy strong, equity strong
  -> Significance rung 4 (establishes a scalable public-health intervention) -> The Lancet (Article).
```

The numbers are not the deciding factor — Study A has a tidy effect but no practice-changing, globally relevant claim, while Study B changes a public-health decision at scale with an equity lens. That contrast is the fit gate.

## Reviewer / editor-pushback patterns and the venue-specific fix

- *"Global-health relevance / equity not addressed."* → State who the result serves beyond a high-income setting; add the PROGRESS-Plus/LMIC generalisability angle or reroute to a family title.
- *"This is incremental over the authors' prior work."* → Name the specific decision it now changes; if it changes none, the venue is wrong.
- *"The endpoint is a surrogate with no demonstrated clinical or policy consequence."* → Show the downstream clinical/policy impact, or move to a specialty title.
- *"The claim outruns the design."* → Narrow to what the design supports; over-claiming is a top rejection reason — confirm scope expectations against the journal's current author guidelines.

## Output format

```
【Lancet lens scores】 importance / global relevance / practice-or-policy change / equity (each: strong / weak)
【Significance rung】 1–5 + one-line justification
【Fatal triggers present】 [...]
【Recommended venue】 The Lancet / Lancet Global Health / Lancet Public Health / specialty title / EClinicalMedicine / NEJM-JAMA-BMJ
【If staying with The Lancet, the one sentence of clinical/global importance】 "..."
【Next】 lancet-study-design (if pass) | reconsider venue (if fail)
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Do not** dress a local, confirmatory result as "globally relevant" with adjectives — editors discount adjectives.
- **Do not** confuse statistical significance or trial size with clinical importance.
- **Do not** let sunk cost (the trial is finished) drive the venue decision.
- **Do not** ignore the equity/global angle — it is often what distinguishes a Lancet paper from an NEJM one.
