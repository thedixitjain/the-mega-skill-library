# R&R Rebuttal (devpsych-rebuttal)

A Developmental Psychology **R&R** typically asks for **a measurement-invariance test, an attrition
analysis, added robustness, fuller JARS disclosure, or stronger transparency** — and all of it must fit
back inside the **length tier**, with masking intact if review is masked. The response letter must convert
every reviewer and reassure the handling editor that the **developmental claim is credible**.

## When to trigger

- An R&R arrived and you are planning the revision + response letter
- Reviewers requested invariance, attrition, added analyses, or open-science changes
- A requested analysis would change the trajectory or the claim
- Writing the cover note to the editor

## Strategy

1. **Read the editor's letter as the rubric.** Solve the decisive developmental-credibility points first
   (often: invariance, age-vs-cohort, attrition); the editor adjudicates among reviewers.
2. **Point-by-point, every comment.** Quote each comment, then respond; never skip one.
3. **Strengthen the developmental claim, don't just defend.** Most requests — report invariance, model
   attrition with FIML/MI, add a robustness model, justify N, share data — make the paper stronger. Do
   them and say where; update the data-availability statement if sharing changed.
4. **Manage the length tier.** New robustness usually belongs in **online supplemental material** so the
   main text stays within budget; summarize briefly in the main text and point to the supplement.
5. **Concede or rebut with evidence.** Did what was asked (cite the location), or push back respectfully
   with a reason — and never add an analysis that quietly undercuts the change claim without disclosing it.
6. **Keep masking and sync deposits.** Keep the revised manuscript and links anonymized if review is
   masked, and ensure new analyses are reflected in the shared scripts/data
   (see `devpsych-open-science-and-transparency`).

## Response-letter format

For each reviewer comment:

```
> [Quoted reviewer comment]

Response: [What we did / why we respectfully disagree].
Change: [Main text section, supplement section, or table/figure number].
```

Open with a short **summary of the main changes** to the editor; group by reviewer; end each entry with
the location (note when content went to the supplement to protect the length tier).

## Worked micro-example (illustrative response entries)

For the three-wave effortful-control package, an R&R asked for invariance, attrition handling, and N.

```
> R2: You interpret growth, but is the measure invariant across ages 4-8?

Response: A fair and important point. We now test measurement invariance
before interpreting change: configural, metric, and scalar invariance hold
across waves (ΔCFI < .01; table now in Results). Mean change is therefore
interpretable on a common metric.
Change: Results (new invariance subsection + Table 2); Method (test plan).

> R1: Attrition (18%) could bias the trajectory.

Response: We refit all models with FIML under MAR and compared completers
and dropouts on baseline covariates (no differences). A pattern-mixture
sensitivity analysis leaves the slope and interaction unchanged.
Change: Results (FIML); attrition + sensitivity analysis → Supplement S2.
```

## R&R triage — where each request lands

| Reviewer ask | Default home (protects the length tier) | Note |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|------|
| Measurement-invariance test | Method + Results (it underwrites the claim) | compact table; full fit indices to supplement |
| Attrition / missing-data analysis | Results + supplement | FIML/MI in text; full table in supplement |
| Added robustness / alternative model | online supplemental material | one summarizing sentence in main text |
| "Address age vs. cohort" | Discussion (+ design note) | reframe or add covariate/sequential argument |
| Fuller JARS disclosure | Method + data-availability statement | a table, not prose, to save words |
| Effect-size/CI reporting | tables and inline | route exhibits to `devpsych-tables-figures` |

## Recurring R&R pushback and the venue fix

- "Trajectory without invariance" → add the configural→metric→scalar test and interpret change only at
  the level achieved; this is the single most common developmental R&R request.
- "You deleted dropouts" → refit with FIML/MI and add the attrition analysis; never argue from completers
  alone.
- "Added analysis quietly weakens the effect" → disclose it, interpret it, and scale the claim; concealment
  is the cardinal sin.
- "Revision busts the tier" → push new robustness to online supplemental material and cite it.

## Anti-patterns

- Ignoring or merging away a comment without a visible response
- Cramming new robustness into the main text and busting the length tier
- Capitulating to a change that breaks the developmental logic
- Adding analyses that contradict the change claim without acknowledgment
- Letting shared data/scripts/data-availability statement drift out of sync with the revision
- Reintroducing identifying information into the masked revision

## Output format

```
【Editor's decisive points】addressed first? [list]
【Coverage】every reviewer comment answered? [Y/N]
【Claim strengthened】invariance/attrition/power/disclosure improved? [Y/N]
【Length tier】new material in supplement; main text within limit? [Y/N]
【Transparency updated】scripts/data/data-availability statement in sync? [Y/N]
【Masking intact】[Y/N/NA]
【Next】resubmit via Editorial Manager
```
