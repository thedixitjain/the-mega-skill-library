# Experimentation Throughput Strategy

Use this skill to increase the rate of product experimentation without turning
the experiment pipeline into an unreliable traffic jam. It focuses on testing
capacity, isolated versus overlapping strategies, interaction effects, and the
process/tooling needed to coordinate experiments at scale.

## Source Traceability

Primary source: *Next-Level A/B Testing* by Leemay Nassery. Guidance is
transformed and paraphrased from Chapter 1 on rate, quality, and cost; Chapter
2 on testing availability, isolated and overlapping strategies, and interaction
effects; and Chapter 9 on balancing rate with quality, cost, and usability.

Related skills:

- `ab-testing-platform-strategy` for platform architecture and ownership.
- `experiment-verification-monitoring` for monitoring conflicts and active-test
  health.
- `experiment-sensitivity-optimization` for reducing traffic needs by improving
  metric sensitivity.

## Reference Routing

| Need | Read |
|------|------|
| Throughput concepts and terminology | `references/core/knowledge.md` |
| Strategy selection and coordination rules | `references/core/rules.md` |
| Scenario examples and tradeoffs | `references/core/examples.md` |
| Step-by-step throughput plan | `workflows/improve-experiment-throughput.md` |

## Workflow

1. Map the current experiment pipeline and where tests wait.
2. Identify whether the bottleneck is traffic, coordination, tooling, review,
   QA, analysis, or decision latency.
3. Decide whether isolated testing, overlapping testing, or a hybrid model fits
   the product surface and metric precision needs.
4. Define interference and interaction-effect safeguards.
5. Add visibility: current tests, upcoming tests, capacity, ownership, and
   conflict flags.
6. Write rollout rules so teams know when to schedule, overlap, defer, or split
   experiments.

```

## Quality Bar

- Do not increase experiment count by ignoring validity risks.
- Do not default to isolated testing when capacity is the primary constraint and
  experiments can run independently.
- Do not default to overlapping testing when experiments change the same user
  journey, metric, or surface in ways that can interact.
- Make the coordination mechanism explicit; "teams will communicate" is not a
  scalable throughput strategy.
