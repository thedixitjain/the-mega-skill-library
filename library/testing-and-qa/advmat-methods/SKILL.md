# Advanced Materials Methods & Characterization (advmat-methods)

## When to trigger

- Your structure or phase assignment rests on a single technique
- A reviewer of a prior draft asked "how do you know it is this phase / this mechanism?"
- The device metric has no benchmarking against comparable state-of-the-art systems
- The Experimental Section sprawls, or you cannot tell what belongs in the body vs. the SI
- Reproducibility is thin: batch-to-batch spread, synthesis provenance, or statistics are missing

## The multi-technique principle

An Adv. Mater. claim about a material must be **triangulated by complementary techniques**, not asserted from one. A single XRD pattern or one TEM image is rarely enough; referees expect the structure–composition–property picture to close from several independent angles.

A practical characterization matrix (adapt to your material class):

| Claim you are making            | Do not rely on one technique — triangulate with                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crystal structure / phase       | XRD (+ Rietveld) **and** electron diffraction (SAED) / HRTEM lattice     |
| Morphology / size / architecture| SEM **and** TEM (+ statistics over many particles, not one hero image)   |
| Composition / oxidation state   | XPS **and** EDS/EELS mapping **and** ICP-MS/AES for bulk stoichiometry    |
| Local bonding / defects         | Raman / FTIR / XAS (XANES/EXAFS), NMR where applicable                    |
| Optoelectronic property         | UV-vis / PL / TAS + the transport or device measurement it predicts      |
| Electrochemical performance     | CV + galvanostatic cycling + rate/stability data + post-mortem analysis   |

State uncertainties and sample counts. "n = 3 devices, mean ± s.d." beats a single best cell.

## Benchmarking is not optional

Adv. Mater. device claims live or die on **fair comparison to the state of the art**. Put the comparison in the paper, on equal footing:

- Compare against the best *reported* systems for the same function, under comparable conditions — cite them.
- Report the metric with its measurement protocol (scan rate, illumination, active area, humidity) so it is comparable.
- If you claim a record, show a benchmark table or plot (e.g. an efficiency-vs-stability or Ragone-style comparison) rather than a bare number.

## Body vs. Experimental Section vs. Supporting Information

| Detail type                                   | Main text / Experimental Section   | Supporting Information            |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Core synthesis route + key parameters          | Experimental Section (reproducible)| full optimization sweeps          |
| The decisive characterization proving the claim| main-text figure                   | extended datasets, more samples   |
| Device fabrication + measurement protocol      | Experimental Section               | full protocols, control devices   |
| Benchmarking vs. state of the art              | main text                          | full comparison table + refs      |
| Statistics on the headline metric              | main text (n, mean ± s.d.)         | per-sample data, histograms       |
| Instrument models / settings                   | Experimental Section (concise)     | exhaustive parameters             |

The Experimental Section must let a competent group **reproduce** the material. Detail that is essential-but-bulky (full recipes, calibration, secondary controls) goes to the SI and is cited inline.

## Rigor without bulk

- Pre-empt the leading alternative explanation for your structure/property claim **in the body**, briefly, and point to the SI for the exhaustive checks.
- Report purity/phase fraction, not just "phase-pure" as an adjective.
- Give data-availability and, where relevant, computational details (see `resources/external_tools.md` for the DFT/simulation stack).

## Checklist

- [ ] Every structural/compositional claim is supported by ≥2 complementary techniques
- [ ] Morphology/size claims carry statistics, not a single hero image
- [ ] The headline metric is benchmarked against cited state-of-the-art systems, fairly
- [ ] Device metrics report the full measurement protocol (area, conditions, scan rate)
- [ ] The headline number carries a sample count and spread (n, mean ± s.d.)
- [ ] The Experimental Section is reproducible; bulky detail is in the SI and cited
- [ ] The leading alternative explanation is named and addressed

## Anti-patterns

- A single-technique structure claim ("XRD confirms the phase") with no corroboration
- One flattering TEM/SEM image standing in for a distribution
- A record metric with no benchmarking and no measurement conditions
- Reporting one best device and hiding batch-to-batch variability
- An Experimental Section too vague to reproduce, or so long it belongs in the SI
- "Data available on request" instead of a concrete availability statement

## Output format

```
【Central material claim】...
【Triangulation】technique 1 / technique 2 / technique 3 — sufficient?  yes / add: ...
【Morphology statistics】present?  yes / fix
【Benchmarking vs. SOTA】in main text, fair, cited?  yes / fix
【Metric statistics】n + spread stated?  yes / fix
【Reproducibility】Experimental Section reproducible?  yes / fix
【Next】advmat-figures (characterization figure) or advmat-supplementary (SI partition)
```
