# Acceptance Test Critique Dimensions

Load when performing peer review of acceptance tests (during *handoff-develop).

## Dimension 1: Happy Path Bias

**Pattern**: Only successful scenarios, error paths missing.

Detection: Count success vs error scenarios. Error should be at least 40%. Missing coverage examples: login success but no invalid password | Payment processed but no decline/timeout | Search results but no empty/error cases.

Severity: blocker (production error handling untested).

## Dimension 2: GWT Format Compliance

**Pattern**: Scenarios violate Given-When-Then structure.

Violations: Missing Given context | Multiple When actions (split into separate scenarios) | Then with technical assertions instead of business outcomes. Each scenario: Given (context), When (single action), Then (observable outcome).

Severity: high (tests not behavior-driven).

## Dimension 3: Business Language Purity

**Pattern**: Technical terms leak into acceptance tests.

Flag: database, API, HTTP, REST, JSON, classes, methods, services, controllers, status codes (500, 404), infrastructure (Redis, Kafka, Lambda).

Business alternatives: "Customer data is stored" not "Database persists record" | "Order is confirmed" not "API returns 200 OK" | "Payment fails" not "Gateway throws exception"

Severity: high (tests coupled to implementation).

## Dimension 4: Coverage Completeness

**Pattern**: User stories lack acceptance test coverage.

Validation: Map each story to scenarios | Verify all AC have corresponding tests | Confirm edge cases and boundaries tested.

Severity: blocker (unverified requirements).

## Dimension 5: Walking Skeleton User-Centricity

**Pattern**: Walking skeletons describe technical layer connectivity instead of user value.

Detection litmus test for `@walking_skeleton` scenarios:
- Title describes user goal or technical flow?
- Then steps describe user observations or internal side effects?
- Could non-technical stakeholder confirm "yes, that is what users need"?

Violations: "End-to-end order flow through all layers" (technical framing) | Then "order row inserted in database" (internal side effects) | Given "database contains user record" instead of "customer has an account"

Severity: high (skeletons that only prove wiring miss the point -- first skeleton should be demo-able to stakeholder).

## Dimension 6: Priority Validation

**Pattern**: Tests address secondary concerns while larger gaps exist.

Questions: 1. Is this the largest bottleneck? (timing data or gap analysis) | 2. Simpler alternatives considered? | 3. Constraint prioritization correct? | 4. Test design decisions data-justified?

Severity: blocker if wrong problem addressed, high if no measurement data.

## Dimension 7: Observable Behavior Assertions

**Pattern**: Tests assert internal state or method calls instead of observable behavior.

For EVERY Then step in EVERY scenario, apply this mechanical checklist:

1. Does the assertion check a return value from a driving port call? YES = pass, NO = flag.
2. Does the assertion check an observable outcome (user sees X, system produces Y)? YES = pass, NO = flag.
3. Does the assertion check internal state, private fields, or method call counts? YES = REJECT the scenario.

**Concrete violations to flag**:
- `assert mock_repo.save.called` — asserts method call, not observable outcome
- `assert len(db.query(Order).all()) == 1` — asserts internal DB state
- `assert obj._internal_field == "value"` — asserts private state
- `assert os.path.exists("output.json")` — asserts file existence (implementation detail)

**Concrete passing assertions**:
- `assert result.is_confirmed()` — observable business outcome
- `assert result.order_number is not None` — return value from driving port
- `assert "confirmation" in customer_notification.subject` — observable user outcome

**Relationship to Dim 5 (Walking Skeleton User-Centricity)**:
- Dim 5 validates walking skeleton SCOPE (user goal framing vs technical layer framing)
- Dim 7 validates ASSERTION TYPE for ALL scenarios (walking skeletons AND focused scenarios)
- A scenario can pass Dim 5 (good user-centric framing) and fail Dim 7 (internal state assertions)

Severity: high (tests coupled to implementation break on refactoring).

## Dimension 8: Traceability Coverage

**Pattern**: Scenarios exist without traceability to upstream wave artifacts.

Two mandatory traceability checks:

**Check A — Story-to-Scenario mapping**:
1. Read `docs/feature/{feature-id}/discuss/user-stories.md`
2. Extract ALL story IDs (e.g., US-01, US-02)
3. For EACH story ID, verify at least one scenario references it (via tag or comment)
4. Flag EVERY story ID with zero matching scenarios as BLOCKER

**Check B — Environment-to-Scenario mapping**:
1. Read `docs/feature/{feature-id}/devops/environments.yaml`
2. If missing, use defaults: `clean`, `with-pre-commit`, `with-stale-config`
3. For EACH environment, verify at least one walking skeleton includes a Given clause referencing that environment's preconditions
4. Flag EVERY environment with zero matching Given clauses as HIGH

**What this dimension does NOT cover**:
- KPI measurability — that is PO-reviewer scope during DELIVER post-merge gate
- Scenario quality — covered by Dims 1-7

Severity: blocker for Check A (untraceable requirements), high for Check B (untested environments).

```

## Reviewer Scope Boundaries

The acceptance-designer-reviewer (Sentinel) owns Dimensions 1-9 during DISTILL.

Responsibilities that belong to OTHER reviewers (do NOT evaluate these):
- **KPI measurability**: PO-reviewer validates during DELIVER post-merge gate
- **Infrastructure readiness**: PA-reviewer validates during DEVOPS-to-DISTILL handoff
- **Code quality**: Software-crafter-reviewer validates during DELIVER Phase 4

If a finding touches KPI measurement or infrastructure readiness, tag it `@escalate:{reviewer}` in the review output and move on. Do NOT attempt to evaluate it.

## Dimension 9: Walking Skeleton Boundary Proof

For walking skeleton scenarios, validate that the WS actually proves adapter wiring with real I/O.

### 9a: WS Strategy Declaration

Is the WS strategy declared in wave-decisions.md?
- NOT declared: BLOCKER (ask the user to confirm auto-detected strategy)

### 9b: WS Strategy-Implementation Match

Does the WS implementation match the declared strategy?
- Strategy C declared but WS uses @in-memory for all adapters: BLOCKER
- Strategy B declared but no @requires_external marker for costly deps: HIGH

### 9c: Adapter Integration Coverage

Does every driven adapter have a real I/O integration test?
- Missing adapter test: BLOCKER regardless of WS strategy

### 9d: Walking Skeleton Fixture Tier

Walking skeleton fixtures — what adapter tier do they use?
- Litmus test: "If I deleted the real adapter, would this WS still pass?"
- If YES for a local resource adapter: WS is testing InMemory, not wiring. REJECT.

### 9e: Strategy Drift Detection

Grep for @in-memory on walking skeleton scenarios under strategies B/C/D.
- If found: HIGH — WS claims real adapters but uses InMemory
