# 80/20 in redesign targeting

A common failure mode of redesigns: trying to redo everything. The result is years-long projects that ship late, lose institutional context, and arrive in a state no better than incremental updates would have produced. The 80/20 rule applied to redesign: identify the surfaces that produce most of user pain or business value; concentrate redesign effort there; leave the rest alone or batch into a maintenance pass.

## How to identify high-value surfaces

### 1. Pain analysis

Where do users struggle? Sources:
- Support ticket categorization (which surfaces generate the most "how do I..." or "I can't..." tickets)
- Session recordings and rage-click analytics
- Drop-off / abandonment metrics (where users leave the funnel)
- Time-on-task for primary flows (where users get stuck)

The 80/20 cut: ~20% of surfaces typically account for ~80% of pain.

### 2. Traffic analysis

Where do users actually spend time? A beautiful but rarely-visited page deserves less polish than an ugly but constantly-used one.

Cross-reference traffic with the surface's role: a low-traffic but business-critical surface (Settings → Billing) earns redesign even if traffic alone wouldn't justify it.

### 3. Business-impact analysis

Conversion surfaces (sign-up, checkout, upgrade) often punch above their traffic weight. A 5% lift on a low-traffic checkout might exceed a 30% lift on a high-traffic blog.

### 4. Strategic-fit analysis

Some surfaces represent the brand or category position. The marketing home page, the first-run experience, the demo screen for sales. These deserve disproportionate attention because they shape perception of the whole product.

## The redesign 80/20 plan

A typical redesign plan that respects 80/20:

```
Phase 1 (the critical 20% — heavy investment)
  - Top 3–5 user-facing surfaces by pain × traffic × business impact
  - Full redesign: research, design, build, polish, A/B test
  - Often 60–70% of the project budget

Phase 2 (the meaningful tail — moderate investment)
  - Next 10–15 surfaces
  - Update to new design system; fix obvious issues; don't redesign whole flows
  - 20–30% of budget

Phase 3 (the rest — minimal investment)
  - All remaining surfaces
  - Apply new design system tokens; update components; cosmetic only
  - 10% of budget

Phase 4 (revisit)
  - Six months in: re-measure. The "rest" that wasn't redesigned might still be performing fine.
  - For surfaces that turn out to be problematic, fold into the next cycle.
```

Phases 1–3 ship over the course of the project; Phase 4 is the post-mortem that informs the next cycle.

## When the 80/20 cut hurts

- **Design system consistency.** If only 20% of surfaces get the new design and 80% don't, the product feels visually fragmented. Mitigation: even surfaces that don't get full redesign should adopt the design system tokens (color, type, spacing) for consistency.
- **Migration burden.** Mixing old and new components creates maintenance complexity. Plan for the eventual deprecation of old components even if you're not redesigning every surface that uses them.
- **Edge-case surfaces.** A surface used by 1% of users might be the *only* surface for a critical use case. The 80/20 cut shouldn't drop it.

## Anti-patterns

- **The Big Bang redesign.** Two-year project to redesign everything. Ships late, loses context, doesn't move metrics.
- **Surface-by-surface without strategy.** Each surface designed independently with no shared system. Result: visual inconsistency.
- **Pet-surface focus.** The team enjoys redesigning the most fun surfaces (marketing landing) while neglecting the highest-pain ones (settings, billing).
- **No measurement.** A redesign ships with no before/after metrics. The team can't tell if it worked.

## Heuristics

1. **The pain-traffic matrix.** Plot surfaces by pain × traffic. Concentrate redesign on the top-right quadrant.
2. **The "would users notice?" check.** For each candidate surface, ask: if we redesigned this and showed users, would they tell us it's better? If "probably not," lower priority.
3. **The conversion-impact estimate.** For business-critical surfaces, estimate revenue impact of a 10% lift. Surfaces where 10% lift is meaningful deserve A/B tested redesign; surfaces where it isn't deserve cosmetic-only updates.
4. **The post-redesign metric.** Define metrics before the redesign ships. If you can't measure improvement, you didn't redesign for the right reason.

## Related sub-skills

- **`80-20-rule`** (parent).
- **`80-20-feature-prioritization`** — applied to new feature planning rather than redesign.
- **`iteration`** (process) — redesigns benefit from iterative releases, not big bangs.
- **`factor-of-safety`** (process) — redesign with safety: A/B test, kill-switch, rollback paths.
