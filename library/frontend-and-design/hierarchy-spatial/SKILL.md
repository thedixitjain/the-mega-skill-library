# Hierarchy through space

Spatial hierarchy uses three tools: **position**, **size** (relative to neighbors), and **whitespace** (isolation around an element). Together they can carry a complete hierarchy without depending on typography or color. Spatial hierarchy is what makes a magazine spread or a museum poster work even before you read a word.

## When this is the decisive sub-aspect

- You're laying out a hero, dashboard, gallery, or any composition where placement and size are doing more work than type.
- You're reviewing a screen where "everything has the same weight" — the typographic hierarchy is fine but the layout is flat.
- You need to elevate one element among many roughly equivalent ones (a featured project, a recommended plan, a primary metric).
- You're working in a constrained type system (one or two sizes) and need hierarchy from elsewhere.

## Core ideas

### Size relative to neighbors carries hierarchy

Absolute size matters less than *relative* size. A 200×200 card next to other 200×200 cards is neutral. The same card at 200×200 next to seven 100×100 cards is dominant. Scale operates *against the local norm*; design hierarchy by establishing a norm and then breaking it deliberately.

In CSS Grid, this is `grid-column: span N` and `grid-row: span N`:

```html
<section style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); gap: 1rem;">
  <article class="featured" style="grid-column: span 2; grid-row: span 2;">…primary…</article>
  <article>…secondary…</article>
  <article>…secondary…</article>
  <article>…secondary…</article>
  <article>…secondary…</article>
  <article>…secondary…</article>
  <article>…secondary…</article>
</section>
```

The featured article occupies four times the area of its neighbors. The eye lands there first.

### Position privileges (in left-to-right scripts)

The eye, given an unfamiliar uniform layout, falls back to the **Z-pattern** (Gutenberg Diagram): top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right. Use this:

- **Top-left** is the *primary optical area*. A logo, page title, or brand mark goes here naturally.
- **Top-right** is the *strong fallow*. Useful for a primary CTA or account chrome.
- **Bottom-right** is the *terminal area*. The eye exits here; place the conversion CTA in conversion-focused layouts.
- **Bottom-left** is the *weak fallow*. Recede secondary content here.

When hierarchy is *strong*, this default is overridden by the dominant element. When hierarchy is *weak*, the Z-pattern takes over by default.

In RTL scripts, mirror the pattern.

### Whitespace as a hierarchy signal

Whitespace around an element communicates importance. A primary heading with 4rem of margin above and below reads as more significant than the same heading with 0.5rem of margin. The element seems to *occupy* its space, not merely *fill* it.

The rough rule: *the more space around an element, the more important it appears* — up to a point where excess space starts to read as accident or empty page.

A worked example using a vertical rhythm:

```css
:root {
  --rhythm-tight: 0.25rem;   /* between label and input */
  --rhythm-base:  1rem;      /* between fields in a section */
  --rhythm-loose: 2rem;      /* between sections */
  --rhythm-major: 4rem;      /* between page regions */
  --rhythm-hero:  8rem;      /* hero/marketing surfaces */
}

.field-group   > * + * { margin-top: var(--rhythm-tight); }
.section       > * + * { margin-top: var(--rhythm-base); }
.page          > section + section { margin-top: var(--rhythm-loose); }
.page-region   { padding-block: var(--rhythm-major); }
.hero-section  { padding-block: var(--rhythm-hero); }
```

Five rhythm levels, each ~2x the previous. The eye reads the spacing as nesting: the things closest are most related; the things farthest are most separate (Proximity); the things with the most surrounding space are most important (Hierarchy).

### Aspect ratio and orientation

A wide element reads as expansive (banner, hero); a tall element reads as deep (sidebar, column); a square element reads as neutral (card, tile). Choose aspect ratio to match the role:

- **Hero / banner / page header** — wide (≥ 16:9 or 21:9). Establishes presence.
- **Card / tile** — square or 4:3 / 3:4. Neutral; designed to repeat.
- **Sidebar / column** — tall and narrow. Recedes laterally.
- **Modal / dialog** — typically 4:3 or 3:2 — wide enough for content, tall enough to feel deliberate.

Mismatching aspect to role makes hierarchy fight the layout.

### Centering and alignment as hierarchy signals

Center alignment is high-attention but inflexible (you can't add another centered thing without competition). Left alignment is lower-attention but extensible. Right alignment is rare and signals secondary action (e.g., toolbar overflow menu).

A useful rule: **center the one element you want the user to look at first; left-align everything else.**

```html
<section class="hero">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Run payroll in minutes</h1>      <!-- centered: the focal element -->
  <p   style="text-align: center;">Not hours. Not the next morning.</p>  <!-- centered: paired support -->
  <div style="text-align: center;"><button>Start free trial</button></div>
</section>

<section class="features" style="margin-top: 6rem;">
  <h2>What you get</h2>           <!-- left-aligned: secondary section -->
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic tax calculations</li>
    <li>Direct deposit to 50 states</li>
    <li>Year-end W-2 / 1099 generation</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

The hero is centered; the rest is left-aligned. The eye registers the difference and treats the hero as the moment.

## Worked example: a marketing landing page

Combining all the spatial hierarchy tools:

```html
<main class="landing">
  <!-- Hero: centered, generous space, dominant -->
  <section style="padding: 8rem 1rem; text-align: center;">
    <h1 style="font-size: 4rem; max-width: 32ch; margin: 0 auto;">
      Run payroll in minutes, not hours
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; max-width: 50ch; margin: 1.5rem auto 0;">
      Built for small teams that don't have a dedicated finance person.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-top: 3rem;">
      <button class="primary">Start free trial</button>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Features: 3-up grid, left-aligned, recessed -->
  <section style="padding: 4rem 1rem; max-width: 1100px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2>Designed for small teams</h2>
    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem;">
      <article><h3>Automatic taxes</h3><p>...</p></article>
      <article><h3>Direct deposit</h3><p>...</p></article>
      <article><h3>Year-end forms</h3><p>...</p></article>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Featured customer: dominant within its section -->
  <section style="padding: 4rem 1rem; background: #f7f7f7;">
    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; gap: 4rem; max-width: 1100px; margin: 0 auto;">
      <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5;">
        "We went from spending two days on payroll each month to twenty minutes."
      </blockquote>
      <div>
        <p>Clara Mendoza</p>
        <p>COO, Bright Labs</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
</main>
```

Three spatial hierarchies: hero dominant via centering + space; features uniform via grid; testimonial dominant within its section via 2:1 split. The page reads top-to-bottom with clear focal moments.

## Anti-patterns

- **Equal-space everything.** Every section the same height, every gap the same size. The eye gets no rhythm; the whole page feels mechanical.
- **Centered everything.** Centering for emphasis works because most content is left-aligned. Center every paragraph and the emphasis collapses.
- **The fold panic.** Cramming the hero, three features, and a CTA "above the fold" because of an imagined scroll-aversion. Modern users scroll without resistance; let the hero breathe and the CTA earn its place.
- **The wall of cards.** A grid of identical cards with no featured tile is a "browsing" composition, not a "reading" composition. If the user is supposed to act, elevate one card.
- **Whitespace where attention should be.** Massive whitespace around a recessive element makes the eye land on emptiness. Whitespace amplifies attention; aim it at things that earn it.

## Heuristics

1. **Mass diagram.** Sketch the page as filled black blocks with no detail. The dominant block should be 2–4× any other. If all blocks are similar size, hierarchy is flat.
2. **The 30-foot test.** Stand back from your screen at distance until labels are unreadable. The composition should still tell you what's important.
3. **Trace the eye-path.** Draw the line your eye follows through the composition. It should land on the primary first, sweep through secondaries, and exit at a CTA or terminal. If your eye-path is chaotic or returns to the primary repeatedly, refine.

## Related principles

- **`hierarchy`** — parent skill. Read it for full framing.
- **`hierarchy-typographic`** — type-driven hierarchy; combines with spatial.
- **`proximity`** — spacing between elements (Gestalt grouping); compounds with spatial hierarchy.
- **`alignment`** — spatial hierarchy operates on a grid; misalignment fights it.
- **`gutenberg-diagram`** — the default eye-path when hierarchy is absent.
- **`horror-vacui`** — the impulse to fill empty space; resist it on important surfaces.
