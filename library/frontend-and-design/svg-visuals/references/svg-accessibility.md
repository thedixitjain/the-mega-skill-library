# SVG Measures: Accessibility

A DAX SVG measure renders as an image keyed off `ImageUrl`; the screen-reader path reads the visual's title, type, author alt text, and the "Show data" table. A cell whose value is an `svg+xml` URI contributes nothing meaningful to either path (Show-data lists the literal markup string), and there is no per-cell alt-text slot. Every inline SVG chart is an accessibility dead zone by default.

## Mitigation at the host-visual level

Apply both of the following for any SVG measure encoding primary KPI data; the second alone is sufficient for decorative micro-charts.

### 1. Keep the numbers in adjacent readable columns

For an SVG sparkline column, also bind the numeric measures the SVG encodes (min, max, last value; actual, target, variance) as plain value columns in the same table or matrix. Show-data then carries real numbers rather than markup strings, satisfying WCAG 1.1.1 for the data-table fallback.

Decide per project which columns to expose vs hide at the visual level (they can be hidden from the visual but still present in the query so Show-data picks them up).

### 2. Set alt text on the host container

Write a concise spoken sentence (under ~250 characters) that narrates the SVG's content and
set it through `pbir`:

```bash
pbir visuals general "Report.Report/MyPage.Page/MyTable.Visual" \
  --altText "Sales trend and current value; use Show data for exact numbers."
```

The current `pbir` command surface does not create a measure-backed dynamic alt-text
expression. If filter-sensitive narration is mandatory, report that capability gap instead of
editing `visual.json`. Keep the encoded numbers in adjacent readable fields so Show data remains
useful.

For an `image` visual rendering a single SVG, the container has a `general.altText` slot; always set it. The static literal form is acceptable when the SVG is not filter-sensitive.

### Decorative SVGs

For purely decorative SVGs (dividers, brand backgrounds), mark the host hidden in tab order so screen readers skip it entirely:

```bash
pbir set "Report.Report/MyPage.Page/MyDecorativeSVG.Visual.position.tabOrder" --value -1
```

## Color-only encoding

An SVG that conveys status purely via `fill`/`stroke` color fails WCAG 1.4.1. Pair every semantic color with at least one of:

- A shape or glyph change (circle vs diamond, filled vs hollow)
- A text label or abbreviation inside the SVG
- A `<title>` element inside the SVG markup itself

The status pill pattern already does this (text label alongside fill color). The dumbbell and bullet patterns do not; add a symbol or label if they are primary status indicators.

## Contrast

SVG elements are subject to the same WCAG contrast requirements as rasterized content:
- Text inside the SVG: >= 4.5:1 against the cell background (3:1 for large text >= 18pt)
- Graphical elements (bars, lines, dots used for data): >= 3:1 against adjacent colors

Theme tokens from the host report's theme do not automatically propagate into an SVG string; verify contrast manually, especially on dark themes or high-contrast accessibility themes.

## What the Desktop Bridge screenshot does not confirm

The Bridge screenshot is useful for layout verification; it does not confirm:
- Alt text is populated and readable
- Adjacent readable columns are present in Show-data
- Tab order positions the visual correctly for keyboard users

Confirm accessibility with `pbir get "...Visual.general.altText"` and
`pbir visuals bind "...Visual" --show`.

## Severity guidance for audit findings

When surfaced by the `review-report` skill:

- Primary KPI SVGs with no alt text and no adjacent numeric column: high severity
- SVG measures with color-only encoding and no paired shape or label: high severity
- Decorative micro-charts with no alt text: medium severity (low if clearly decorative and tab-order is -1)
