# Rust Async Task Design

Use this skill to make Rust async code explicit about task ownership, suspension
points, blocking work, and cancellation. Async is a concurrency model, not a
default replacement for threads or a performance guarantee.

## Core Workflow

1. Identify the async boundary: runtime entrypoint, handler, client call,
   stream, background task, or trait method.
2. Mark every `.await` as a possible suspension point. Check what state is held
   across it.
3. Use `tokio::spawn(async move { ... })` only when the task can own everything
   it needs and its future is `Send + 'static` on the selected runtime.
4. Keep `JoinHandle`s when task success, panic, cancellation, or shutdown
   matters. Do not silently detach important work.
5. Keep blocking IO and CPU-heavy work out of async tasks. Use async APIs,
   `spawn_blocking`, Rayon, or dedicated threads as the workload requires.
6. Do not hold a synchronous `MutexGuard`, `RefCell` borrow, or non-`Send` value
   across `.await`.
7. Add tests for timeout, cancellation, dropped channel, and failed task paths
   when those outcomes affect behavior.

## Runtime Rules

Read `references/async-runtime-patterns.md` when reviewing task spawning,
shared state in async code, or blocking work.

- Use `std::sync::Mutex` in async code only for short, low-contention critical
  sections that do not cross `.await`.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` when a lock must be held across `.await`, but first
  consider moving the state behind a task and interacting by messages.
- Use `spawn_blocking` for blocking operations that eventually finish. Limit
  parallelism for CPU-heavy work; Tokio's blocking pool can grow large.
- Use `tokio::time::timeout` or explicit cancellation tokens for bounded
  operations.
- Use `select!` carefully: dropping a future can cancel it. Check cancellation
  safety before using it around IO or partially completed work.

## Async Trait Rules

- Native `async fn` in traits is fine for private traits and static dispatch
  when callers do not need to add bounds to the returned future.
- Public traits that need `Send` futures should usually spell the method as
  `fn name(...) -> impl Future<Output = T> + Send` or use `trait-variant` to
  offer local and `Send` variants.
- Public traits that need dynamic dispatch usually need an explicit boxed
  future return type, such as `Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = T> + Send + '_>>`.
  Use `async-trait` as an ergonomics layer only when the dependency and
  allocation tradeoff are acceptable.
- Avoid leaking executor-specific types from a trait unless the trait is
  intentionally runtime-specific.

## Review Checklist

- No lock or borrow crosses `.await` accidentally.
- Spawned tasks own their inputs with `async move`.
- Important `JoinHandle`s are awaited, monitored, or aborted on shutdown.
- Blocking work is isolated and bounded.
- Error paths preserve context instead of becoming `JoinError` or timeout noise.
