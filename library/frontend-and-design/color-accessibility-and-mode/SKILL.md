# Color: accessibility and mode support

Accessibility-aware color isn't a polish layer; it's a constraint that shapes the palette from the start. Adding accessibility late is much more expensive than building it in. The core constraints: WCAG contrast ratios, color-blindness compatibility, high-contrast mode support, and dark-mode parity.

## WCAG contrast in practice

Required ratios (relative luminance):

| Content | Level AA | Level AAA |
|---|---|---|
| Body text (< 18pt regular or < 14pt bold) | 4.5:1 | 7:1 |
| Large text (≥ 18pt regular or ≥ 14pt bold) | 3:1 | 4.5:1 |
| UI components and graphical objects | 3:1 | (no AAA) |

To check a color pair: any contrast tool (WebAIM, Stark, Chrome DevTools' contrast inspector). If you're picking from a designer's mockup, run every text/background pair through. Common failures:

- Light grey body text on white (`#999` or `#aaa`).
- Brand-color body links on white when the brand is mid-tone.
- Placeholder text in inputs (often unreadable).
- White text on light brand backgrounds.

**Practical rule**: pick body text colors at neutral-700 or darker on light backgrounds; never use anything lighter than neutral-500 for content the user must read.

## Color blindness

Approximate prevalence in populations of European descent:

- **Deuteranopia / deuteranomaly** (red-green): ~6% of men, ~0.4% of women.
- **Protanopia / protanomaly** (red-green, slightly different): ~2% of men.
- **Tritanopia / tritanomaly** (blue-yellow): ~0.01%.
- **Achromatopsia** (full color blindness): ~0.003%.

Other populations have different rates — generally lower red-green prevalence in some Asian populations.

Practical implications:

- Don't rely on red-green distinction alone for status. Use icon, text, or pattern alongside.
- Avoid red-on-green or green-on-red combinations for important text.
- Test with simulators: Chrome DevTools → Rendering → Emulate vision deficiencies. Or Stark, Sim Daltonism, Color Oracle.

## Dark mode

Dark mode is no longer optional for new products. Macs, iPhones, and Androids all default to dark in some contexts; users expect it.

Common pitfalls:

### Pure inversion is wrong

Inverting a light palette doesn't produce a good dark palette. Saturation perception is different on dark backgrounds; very-saturated colors that read fine on white look glaring on black. Build dark-mode tokens deliberately.

### Tinted neutrals work better than pure black

Pure white text on pure black is high-contrast but hard on the eyes and produces strong "halation" (blur) on OLED screens. Most well-tuned dark modes use:

- A near-black background (not pure black): `hsl(220 10% 8%)`.
- Off-white text: `hsl(0 0% 90%)` or so.
- Tinted neutrals keeping the same hue cast as light mode.

### Adjust saturation downward

Saturated colors that work on white backgrounds need toning down for dark. A primary brand at `hsl(220 90% 50%)` may need to be `hsl(220 70% 60%)` in dark mode to feel comfortable.

### Test contrast in both modes

A pair that passes AA in light mode may fail in dark mode. The luminance values differ; recheck.

## High-contrast mode

Many operating systems offer a high-contrast mode for low-vision users. Web equivalents:

- **Windows High Contrast Mode** (now "contrast themes")
- **`prefers-contrast: more`** CSS media query

In these modes, the user has explicitly requested maximum contrast. Designs should:

- Avoid relying on subtle color distinctions.
- Ensure all text/background pairs hit AAA contrast.
- Avoid background images or gradients that might obscure text.
- Use strong, defined borders.

```css
@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
  :root {
    --neutral-700: hsl(0 0% 0%);
    --background: hsl(0 0% 100%);
    --border: hsl(0 0% 0%);
    /* ...etc... */
  }
}
```

## Forced colors mode

Some users (particularly with low vision or migraine sensitivity) override page colors entirely with system colors via Windows' Forced Colors Mode. The browser maps your colors to a small set of system tokens (`Canvas`, `CanvasText`, `LinkText`, `ButtonText`, `ButtonFace`, etc.).

In this mode:

- Background images may be hidden.
- Custom colors are overridden.
- The page should still be usable.

Design implications:

- Use `<button>` for buttons; the system colors map correctly.
- Don't rely on background images for critical info.
- Test in Forced Colors Mode (Edge: Settings → Accessibility → "High contrast").

## Color and motion / animation

Color transitions can trigger photosensitive epilepsy if they flash rapidly (3+ Hz, especially with red). WCAG 2.3.1: no content flashes more than 3 times per second.

Design implications:

- No strobing animations.
- Loading spinners should rotate, not flash colors.
- Auto-playing animations should respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Worked example: a fully accessibility-aware palette

```css
:root {
  /* Light mode */
  --bg: hsl(0 0% 100%);
  --fg: hsl(220 6% 12%);          /* near-black; contrast 17:1 on white */
  --fg-muted: hsl(220 6% 40%);    /* 7.4:1 — passes AA body, AAA large */
  --primary: hsl(220 90% 45%);    /* 5:1 on white — AA body */
  --destructive: hsl(0 75% 40%);  /* 5.5:1 on white — AA body */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg: hsl(220 10% 9%);
    --fg: hsl(220 6% 92%);          /* 12:1 on dark */
    --fg-muted: hsl(220 6% 65%);    /* 5.5:1 — AA body */
    --primary: hsl(220 80% 65%);    /* tuned brighter for dark mode */
    --destructive: hsl(0 70% 60%);  /* tuned brighter for dark mode */
  }
}

@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
  :root {
    --fg: hsl(0 0% 0%);
    --bg: hsl(0 0% 100%);
    --fg-muted: hsl(0 0% 20%);
    /* etc. */
  }
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Color-only signals.** Red asterisks for required fields with no `*` or "required." Color-blind users miss it.
- **Light grey body text** that looks "elegant" in mockups but fails AA in production.
- **Dark mode by inversion.** Pure inversion produces glare and saturation issues.
- **Ignoring `prefers-contrast` and `forced-colors`.** Your design works for typical users but fails for users with explicit accessibility needs.
- **Status that depends on hue alone.** Color-blind users can't distinguish red from green; pair with icon and text.

## Heuristics

1. **Run a contrast checker.** Every text/background pair, every UI/background pair. AA at minimum.
2. **Simulate color blindness.** Chrome DevTools or a dedicated tool. Status systems that lean on red/green collapse here.
3. **Test in dark mode.** Toggle the OS preference; check every page.
4. **Test with forced colors.** Edge in High Contrast mode reveals what depends on color.
5. **The grayscale test.** If the design works in grayscale, color is enhancement; if not, color is load-bearing and must satisfy accessibility constraints.
