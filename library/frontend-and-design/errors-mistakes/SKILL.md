# Mistakes: errors of intention

A mistake happens when the user's action matched their intent — but the intent was wrong because their model of the situation was wrong. They misread an alarm; misjudged a chart; chose the wrong option from a menu they misunderstood. Unlike slips, mistakes are usually unrecognized at the moment they happen — the user is confident they're doing the right thing.

The design responses for mistakes work upstream of action: better information, clearer system state, training, conventions that match user expectations.

## The three mistake subtypes (from the book)

### Perception mistakes

Wrong action because of misread information.

**Design responses**:
- Improve situational awareness (clear, distinctive feedback).
- Show trends and historical data, not just point-in-time values.
- Provide clear and distinctive feedback at decision points.

```html
<!-- Point-in-time only — perception-mistake-prone -->
<p>CPU: 45%</p>

<!-- With trend — clearer -->
<div class="metric">
  <p>CPU: 45%</p>
  <span class="trend trend--up">↑ Rising over last hour</span>
  <canvas class="sparkline"></canvas>
</div>
```

### Decision mistakes

Wrong action under stress, bias, or overconfidence.

**Design responses**:
- Minimize information and environmental noise.
- Use checklists and decision trees for high-stakes decisions.
- Train on error recovery and troubleshooting.
- Reduce time pressure where possible.

A monitoring console for production incidents that surfaces a checklist of likely causes ("Check service X first, then Y, then Z") reduces decision mistakes during stressful incidents.

### Knowledge mistakes

Wrong action because of missing knowledge.

**Design responses**:
- Memory and decision aids in context.
- Standardized naming and operational conventions.
- Training using case studies and simulations.
- Mnemonic devices.

A new user encountering an unfamiliar feature for the first time benefits from inline help, walkthroughs, or progressive-disclosure of complexity.

## Common mistake-prevention patterns

### Surfacing system state

Many mistakes flow from invisible system state. The user thinks the system is in mode A; it's actually in mode B; their action is correct for A but wrong for B.

Design response: make state visible. Modal indicators, status bars, breadcrumbs all help.

```html
<header class="env-banner env-banner--prod">
  ⚠ Production environment — actions affect live customers
</header>
```

A visible "PROD" banner on production tools prevents the mistake of running staging-style commands against real customer data.

### Decision trees and guided flows

For complex decisions, walk the user through. Each step narrows the option space.

```
Are you trying to...
  (•) Fix a customer issue
  ( ) Make a code change
  ( ) Run a migration

[Continue]
```

Then based on the answer, the next set of options is contextual. The user can't easily make a mistake by picking from a flat list of 30 options because the context narrows the space.

### Trend-aware displays

Replace point-in-time displays with trend-aware ones. The single number "23%" hides a trajectory; the sparkline reveals it.

### Checklists

Borrowed from aviation and medicine. A checklist forces the user to verify each prerequisite explicitly. Surgical "time-out" checklists, pilot pre-takeoff checklists, and software pre-deployment checklists all prevent decision and knowledge mistakes by externalizing memory.

### Conventions and standards

When users encounter unfamiliar systems, they apply conventions from familiar ones. If your system honors conventions (cmd-K opens command palette, Esc closes overlays), users transfer prior knowledge correctly. If you violate them, users transfer prior knowledge incorrectly — knowledge mistakes ensue.

### Inline help in context

Don't rely on documentation pages users won't visit. Surface help in the moment: a "?" icon next to ambiguous fields with a tooltip, an info-banner explaining a section's purpose, contextual onboarding hints.

## Mistake-prone contexts

- **Novel situations** — the user's model doesn't apply.
- **Ambiguous information** — multiple plausible interpretations.
- **High-stakes decisions under stress** — judgment narrows.
- **Cross-domain transfers** — applying conventions from one domain to another that doesn't share them.
- **Edge cases** — situations the user hasn't seen before.
- **First-time users of any feature** — knowledge gap.

## Anti-patterns

- **Hidden system state.** User assumes the system is in one state; it's actually in another.
- **Cryptic error messages** that don't help the user understand what's wrong.
- **Conventions violated without warning.** A "Save" button that doesn't save, or saves to a different location.
- **Onboarding for new users that's just a tour.** Watching demo videos doesn't transfer knowledge as well as guided practice.
- **Single-point-in-time displays for trending phenomena.** Hides the trajectory.

## Heuristics

1. **The "what's the user's model?" check.** Before designing a flow, ask what model the user is likely to bring. Designs that match it prevent mistakes; designs that violate it cause them.
2. **The state-visibility audit.** What state are users in right now? Can they see it? If not, they can mistake.
3. **The novel-situation walkthrough.** For unfamiliar features, walk a new user through. Note where their model diverges from the system; design responses there.

## Related sub-skills

- **`errors`** (parent).
- **`errors-slips`** — the complementary error type; execution rather than intention.
- **`mental-model`** — mistakes flow from wrong models; mental-model design prevents them.
- **`expectation-effect`** — when the system violates expectation, mistakes follow.
- **`visibility`** — system state must be visible to be reasoned about.
- **`mimicry`** — borrowing conventions reduces knowledge-mistakes.
