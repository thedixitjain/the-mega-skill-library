# AG-UI .NET — human in the loop (approval & interrupts)

Goal: stop an agent run at a decision point, hand control to a person, and resume the same run with their decision — either approving a sensitive tool call or supplying input the agent asked for.

A paused run completes its turn with `RUN_FINISHED { outcome: interrupt }`. The client inspects the response, gets the human decision, then sends a follow-up turn that carries the answer; the SDK reconnects it to the paused tool call so the run continues.

## Approval: gate a tool behind a human yes/no

This is the simple path and needs no custom endpoint code — `ToChatRequestContext` handles the resume.

### Server: wrap the sensitive tool

Wrap the function in `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`. When the model calls it, the function-invoking client raises a `ToolApprovalRequestContent` instead of executing:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

var deleteFile = new ApprovalRequiredAIFunction(
    AIFunctionFactory.Create(DeleteFile, "delete_file", "Deletes a file."));

builder.Services.AddChatClient(/* provider IChatClient */)
    .ConfigureOptions(o => (o.Tools ??= []).Add(deleteFile))
    .UseFunctionInvocation();
```

### Client: detect the request, decide, resume

The first turn returns a `ToolApprovalRequestContent`. Show it to the human, then resume by appending the request and the human's response and streaming again:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

var messages = new List<ChatMessage> { new(ChatRole.User, "Delete report-draft.txt") };

var turn1 = new List<ChatResponseUpdate>();
await foreach (var u in client.GetStreamingResponseAsync(messages))
{
    turn1.Add(u);
}

var request = turn1.SelectMany(u => u.Contents)
                   .OfType<ToolApprovalRequestContent>()
                   .FirstOrDefault();

if (request is { ToolCall: FunctionCallContent call })
{
    bool approved = AskHuman($"Run {call.Name}?");   // your UI / prompt

    messages.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, [request]));
    messages.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, [request.CreateResponse(approved)]));

    await foreach (var u in client.GetStreamingResponseAsync(messages))
    {
        Console.Write(u.Text);   // runs the tool if approved, skips it if not
    }
}
```

On the resumed turn the SDK re-pairs the approval request and response so the function-invoking client executes (or skips) the underlying call.

## Interrupt: ask the user for input mid-run

When the agent needs free-form input (not a yes/no), pause with an `InterruptRequestContent` and resume with an `InterruptResponseContent`. The client side mirrors approval:

```csharp
using AGUI.Abstractions;

var interrupt = turn1.SelectMany(u => u.Contents)
                     .OfType<InterruptRequestContent>()
                     .FirstOrDefault();

if (interrupt is not null)
{
    var answer = AskHuman(interrupt.Message);   // e.g. a username
    var payload = JsonSerializer.SerializeToElement(new { response = answer });

    messages.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, [interrupt]));
    messages.Add(new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User,
        [new InterruptResponseContent(interrupt.RequestId) { Payload = payload }]));

    await foreach (var u in client.GetStreamingResponseAsync(messages))
    {
        Console.Write(u.Text);
    }
}
```

`AGUIChatClient` encodes the response as `RunAgentInput.Resume[]` on the wire. The interrupt request carries a `Reason` (e.g. `InterruptReasons.InputRequired`), a `Message` to display, and an optional `ResponseSchema` describing the expected payload.

On the server, raise the interrupt by yielding a content-bearing update from a `DelegatingChatClient`. Typically you bridge a model tool call into the interrupt: detect the model's `FunctionCallContent`, emit an `InterruptRequestContent(call.CallId)` instead, and on resume rewrite the `InterruptResponseContent` back into the `FunctionCallContent` + `FunctionResultContent` pair the model expects, so it continues as if the tool returned the user's answer.

## Anti-patterns

- **Resuming with only the response content.** Both the request (`ToolApprovalRequestContent` / `InterruptRequestContent`) and the matching response must be in the resumed message list, with the same id; the SDK pairs them to reconnect to the paused call. Sending the response alone leaves the run with nothing to resume.
- **Instructing the model to ask for confirmation in its prompt.** The approval gate is structural — the wrapped tool pauses the run on its own. A prompt that also tells the model to "ask the user to confirm" produces a redundant text question and a second round-trip. Tell the model to call the tool directly and let the gate handle approval.

## Verify

1. First turn ends without running the side effect: the stream finishes `RUN_FINISHED { outcome: interrupt }` and the response contains a `ToolApprovalRequestContent` (or `InterruptRequestContent`).
2. After resuming with approval, the tool's effect occurs and the run finishes normally; after resuming with a rejection, the effect does not occur and the model proceeds without it.
3. For input interrupts, the agent's final answer reflects the value the human supplied.
