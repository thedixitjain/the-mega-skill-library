# Accessibility — Understandable

WCAG Principle 3: information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

The three sub-criteria, simplified:

1. **Readable** — language is identified, jargon is explained, abbreviations are expanded.
2. **Predictable** — the UI behaves consistently and changes context only when the user expects.
3. **Input assistance** — labels, instructions, error messages, and prevention of mistakes.

This sub-principle is where accessibility most overlaps with general usability — but the consequences fall hardest on users with cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, low literacy, or unfamiliarity with the language.

## 1. Readable

### Language identified

Set the document language so screen readers pronounce correctly:

```html
<html lang="en">
```

For mixed-language content, mark the exception:

```html
<p>The French word for "dog" is <span lang="fr">chien</span>.</p>
```

A screen reader switches voice/pronunciation for the marked span.

### Plain language

Write at a reading level appropriate to your audience. For consumer products, that's typically grade 8 or below. Tools (Hemingway Editor, Readable, Microsoft Word's readability stats) measure this.

Practices that improve readability:

- Short sentences (<25 words).
- Active voice ("Click Save" not "Save can be clicked").
- Familiar words (use "buy" not "procure").
- One idea per sentence.
- Paragraphs ≤ 5 sentences.

### Jargon and abbreviations

If you must use jargon or abbreviations, expand them on first use:

```html
<p>
  Single sign-on (<abbr title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr>) lets your team
  use one login across all tools.
</p>
```

Screen readers can announce the expansion via `<abbr title>`. Sighted users see the expansion on hover.

For specialized terms, link to a definition or glossary the first time.

### Pronunciation (rare but worth knowing)

For content where pronunciation determines meaning (poetry, languages, certain proper nouns), provide pronunciation hints. Most apps don't need this; mention it for completeness.

## 2. Predictable

### Behavior on focus and input

WCAG 3.2.1 and 3.2.2: changing the value of an input or moving focus to an element should NOT trigger an unexpected context change.

Specifically:

- A `<select>` should not auto-submit a form when a value changes.
- Focusing an input should not open a popup or navigate.
- Typing into a search field should not navigate to a result page on every keystroke.

If a context change *is* the intended behavior (typeahead search, live filter), make it expected: label the field as "Search (results filter as you type)," show results below the input, don't yank focus.

```html
<!-- Wrong: select auto-submits on change -->
<select onchange="this.form.submit()">
  <option>Country A</option>
  <option>Country B</option>
</select>

<!-- Right: select waits for explicit submit -->
<select name="country">
  <option>Country A</option>
  <option>Country B</option>
</select>
<button type="submit">Continue</button>
```

### Consistent navigation

Same navigation in the same place across pages. The "Help" link in the top-right on page A is in the top-right on page B too. Users (especially those with cognitive impairments or who navigate by spatial memory) rely on this.

If a sub-section needs additional nav, place it in a consistent location (e.g., a left sidebar that always appears in left-sidebar slot).

### Consistent identification

Same component does the same thing across the app. A button labeled "Save" always saves; doesn't sometimes mean "save and close" and sometimes mean "save and continue." If two different actions are needed, two different labels: "Save" and "Save and continue."

Same icon across the app should mean the same thing. A trash icon on one page meaning "delete," another page meaning "filter," is incoherent.

## 3. Input assistance

### Error identification

WCAG 3.3.1: when an error is detected, identify the item in error and describe the error in text.

```html
<div class="field" data-state="error">
  <label for="email">Email address</label>
  <input id="email"
         type="email"
         aria-invalid="true"
         aria-describedby="email-error" />
  <p id="email-error" class="field-error">
    <AlertIcon aria-hidden="true" />
    Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com).
  </p>
</div>
```

Three things are happening:

- `aria-invalid="true"` flags the input as in error (assistive tech may announce).
- `aria-describedby` ties the message to the input (screen readers announce both).
- The message text is specific (says what's wrong) and actionable (offers an example).

### Labels and instructions

Every input has a programmatically associated label. The label is descriptive (not just "Field 1"). If the input requires specific format, instructions are provided alongside.

```html
<!-- Right: label, format hint, and example -->
<div class="field">
  <label for="phone">Phone number</label>
  <input id="phone"
         type="tel"
         aria-describedby="phone-help"
         placeholder="555-123-4567" />
  <p id="phone-help" class="field-help">
    Format: 555-123-4567. We use this only for delivery questions.
  </p>
</div>
```

Notes:

- `placeholder` is *not* a label — it disappears when the user starts typing. Use a real `<label>`.
- Format hints belong in adjacent text (`aria-describedby`), not just placeholder.
- Required fields should be marked both visually (asterisk) and programmatically (`required` attribute or `aria-required`).

### Error suggestion

WCAG 3.3.3 (Level AA): when the user makes an input error and the system can suggest a correction, do so.

```html
<!-- User typed "gmial.com" -->
<p class="field-error">
  Did you mean <button type="button" onclick="acceptSuggestion('gmail.com')">name@gmail.com</button>?
</p>
```

Don't auto-correct silently — that's a context change without consent. Suggest, let the user accept.

### Error prevention

WCAG 3.3.4 (Level AA, for legal/financial/data submissions): the user must be able to:

- **Reverse** the submission (a "Cancel my order" period), OR
- **Check** the submission for errors before final commit (a confirmation page), OR
- **Confirm** explicitly before final commit (a confirm dialog).

For destructive irreversible actions in product UIs (delete account, transfer ownership), this is the strong reason for `AlertDialog` confirmation, type-to-confirm patterns, and 30-day "soft delete" recovery windows.

### Help

WCAG 3.3.5 (Level AAA): context-sensitive help is available. Tooltips, inline help, "What's this?" links.

In product UIs, this lands in:

- `<FieldDescription>` next to inputs that need explanation.
- `?` icons next to settings whose function isn't obvious.
- A persistent help link or chat in chrome.

### Consistent help

WCAG 3.2.6 (Level A, 2.2): if help mechanisms are present (contact info, FAQ link, chat widget), they appear in the same location across pages.

## Worked examples

### Example 1: a credit-card form with full input assistance

```html
<form>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="cc-number">Card number</label>
    <input id="cc-number"
           type="text"
           inputmode="numeric"
           autocomplete="cc-number"
           aria-describedby="cc-help"
           required
           aria-required="true" />
    <p id="cc-help" class="field-help">
      16 digits, no spaces or dashes
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <label for="cc-exp">Expiration (MM/YY)</label>
    <input id="cc-exp"
           type="text"
           inputmode="numeric"
           autocomplete="cc-exp"
           placeholder="MM/YY"
           required
           aria-required="true" />
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <label for="cc-cvc">CVC</label>
    <input id="cc-cvc"
           type="text"
           inputmode="numeric"
           autocomplete="cc-csc"
           aria-describedby="cvc-help"
           required
           aria-required="true" />
    <p id="cvc-help" class="field-help">
      3-digit code on the back of your card (4 on Amex)
    </p>
  </div>

  <button type="submit">Review order</button>
</form>
```

What's happening:

- Each field has a real label (associated via `for`/`id`).
- `inputmode="numeric"` prompts the right keyboard on mobile.
- `autocomplete` attributes let password managers and autofill help.
- Help text is associated via `aria-describedby`.
- Required is both visual (probably an asterisk from CSS) and programmatic (`required` + `aria-required`).
- Submit goes to a "Review order" page (error prevention via review step).

### Example 2: a destructive action with prevention layers

```html
<button onclick="openDeleteDialog()">Delete account</button>

<!-- Dialog: -->
<dialog open
        role="dialog"
        aria-labelledby="confirm-title"
        aria-describedby="confirm-desc">
  <h2 id="confirm-title">Delete your account?</h2>
  <p id="confirm-desc">
    This permanently removes your account, all your projects (12), and your
    team's access (38 members). This cannot be undone.
  </p>
  <p>To confirm, type your account email below:</p>
  <input type="text" placeholder="you@example.com" id="confirm-input" />
  <button type="button">Cancel</button>
  <button type="button"
          class="destructive"
          disabled
          id="confirm-button">
    Delete account permanently
  </button>
</dialog>
```

The user must:

1. Click "Delete account" (intent).
2. Read the dialog (consequences laid out).
3. Type their email (active confirmation, error prevention).
4. Click "Delete account permanently" (final commit).

Each step is a deliberate barrier against accidental destruction.

## Anti-patterns

- **Placeholders as labels.** "Email" in placeholder text only — disappears on type, breaks for screen readers, fails on autofill.
- **Generic error messages.** "Validation failed." Doesn't say which field, doesn't say what's wrong, doesn't say how to fix.
- **Surprise context changes.** Selecting an option auto-navigates; typing in a field auto-submits. The user loses control.
- **Inconsistent labels for the same action.** "Save" here, "Submit" there, "Confirm" elsewhere.
- **No undo and no confirm for destructive actions.** Click-and-it's-gone with no recovery.
- **Jargon without explanation.** "API token rotation period" with no hover or link to explain. The technical user knows; the casual user is lost.

## Heuristics

1. **The five-error test.** Trigger 5 different validation errors. Are all of them named, located near the field, and offered a fix?
2. **The label audit.** Every form input has a `<label>` associated by `for`/`id`. No placeholder-as-label.
3. **The unexpected-change test.** Walk through a form. Does any change of input value or focus trigger a navigation, popup, or auto-submit? Each is a violation.
4. **The "stranger" test.** Show your form to someone unfamiliar with your product. Can they tell what each field wants without help text? If not, label or instruction is wrong.
5. **The grade-level check.** Run your microcopy through a readability tool. Above grade 10 for consumer? Simplify.

## Related skills

- **`accessibility`** (parent).
- **`accessibility-perceivable`**, **`accessibility-operable`**, **`accessibility-robust`** — siblings.
- **`errors`** and **`forgiveness`** (interaction) — error UX is shared between accessibility and general interaction design.
- **`feedback-loop`** (interaction) — feedback that the system received a change is part of predictability.
- **`framing`** (cognition) — error copy framing affects whether the user feels blamed or helped.
- **`mental-model`** (cognition) — predictable behavior aligns with the user's model.
