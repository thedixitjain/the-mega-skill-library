# Sealos Deploy

## Compatibility

Sealos auth/workspace are required for deploys. Docker, buildx, and gh CLI are required only when the selected path needs local build/push. git is required when cloning from a GitHub URL or when git metadata is needed. Node.js 18+ remains an optional accelerator. Phase 5 requires Python 3.8+ with PyYAML; root Compose conversion also requires kompose and may require crane when image tags are floating.


Deploy compatible cloud workloads to Sealos Cloud, stopping unsupported targets
before build or deployment.

## kubectl Safety Rules (all phases)

All kubectl commands MUST use the Sealos kubeconfig:
```
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

System tool installation requires user confirmation. If `docker`, `gh`, or `kubectl` is missing and the skill can install it for the current platform, ask first and only run the install command after the user explicitly replies `y`.

**`kubectl delete` requires user confirmation.** Before deleting any resource (deployment, service, ingress, PVC, database, etc.), always ask:
```
WARNING: About to delete <resource kind>/<resource name>. This data cannot be recovered. Confirm? (y/n)
```
Only proceed after user confirms. This applies even if the pipeline logic suggests deletion — always ask first.

**Template API cleanup must include Instance CRs.** Deployments created through `scripts/deploy-template.mjs` create `instances.app.sealos.io/<app-name>` in addition to App/workload resources. A cleanup is incomplete until `instances.app.sealos.io`, `apps.app.sealos.io`, workloads, Services, Ingresses, PVCs, and Pods are all checked.

Use this check when cleaning Template API test deployments:
```bash
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" \
  get instances.app.sealos.io,app,statefulset,deployment,svc,ingress,pvc,pod | grep "$APP"
```

Delete in this order after confirmation:
```bash
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete instances.app.sealos.io "$APP" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete app "$APP" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete statefulset "$APP" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete deployment "$APP" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete ingress "$APP" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete svc "$APP" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" get pvc -o name | grep "$APP" | while read -r PVC; do
  KUBECONFIG=~/.sealos/kubeconfig kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -n "$NS" delete "$PVC" --ignore-not-found --wait=false
done
```

Anti-example: do not report cleanup complete after only checking `app,statefulset,svc,ingress,pvc,pod`; that misses `instances.app.sealos.io/<app-name>` and leaves the Sealos Instance layer dirty.

## Usage

```
/sealos-deploy <github-url>
/sealos-deploy                    # deploy current project
/sealos-deploy <local-path>
```

## Quick Start

Execute the modules in order:

1. `modules/preflight.md` — Environment checks & Sealos auth
2. `modules/pipeline.md` — Full deployment pipeline (Phase 1–6)
3. `modules/runtime-truth.md` — Post-deploy Runtime Truth Pass (Phase 6.5)

## Logging

Every run MUST write a log file at `~/.sealos/logs/deploy-<YYYYMMDD-HHmmss>.log`.

**At the very start of execution**, create the log file **once**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.sealos/logs
LOG_FILE=~/.sealos/logs/deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] Deploy started" > "$LOG_FILE"
```

**Important: create the log file ONLY ONCE at the start. All subsequent writes MUST append (`>>`) to this same `$LOG_FILE`. Do NOT create a second log file.**

**At each phase boundary**, append a log entry to the same file with Bash `>>`:

## Scripts

Located in `scripts/` within this skill directory (`<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/`):

| Script | Usage | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `workload-eligibility.mjs` | `node workload-eligibility.mjs <repo-dir>` | Read-only fail-closed workload classification; decision is stdout-only |
| `score-model.mjs` | `node score-model.mjs <repo-dir>` | Deterministic readiness scoring (0-12) |
| `detect-template.mjs` | `node detect-template.mjs [--github-url <url>] --work-dir <repo-dir> --skill-dir <SKILL_DIR>` | Detect configured GitHub repo → Sealos template fast-path matches |
| `validate-artifacts.mjs` | `node validate-artifacts.mjs --dir <work-dir>` | Validate `.sealos` JSON artifacts against enforced schemas |
| `detect-image.mjs` | `node detect-image.mjs <github-url> [work-dir]` or `node detect-image.mjs <work-dir>` | Detect existing Docker/GHCR images |
| `build-push.mjs` | `node build-push.mjs <work-dir> <repo> [--registry ghcr\|dockerhub] [--user <user>]` | Build amd64 image & push to the selected registry (Docker Hub path assumes a public image at deploy time; omitting `--registry` keeps auto-detect behavior) |
| `ensure-image-pull-secret.mjs` | `node ensure-image-pull-secret.mjs <namespace> <secret-name> <image-ref> [deployment-name]` | Create/update app-scoped GHCR pull Secret and optionally patch an existing Deployment to reference it |
| `gh-refresh-scopes.mjs` | `node gh-refresh-scopes.mjs write:packages` | Refresh GHCR package access in the current TTY; `write:packages` is sufficient for both push and private pull in this workflow |
| `deploy-template.mjs` | `node deploy-template.mjs <template-path> [--dry-run] [--args-json '{"KEY":"value"}'\|--args-file <file>]` | Resolve the current region from `~/.sealos/auth.json`, build the correct Template API URL, and post a local template YAML |
| `sealos-launchpad-network.mjs` | `node sealos-launchpad-network.mjs --app <app> --app-url <url> [--expected-port <port>] [--region <url>] [--kubeconfig <path>]` | Read-only Launchpad public-network discovery check with App URL and Service port matching |
| `sealos-footprint.mjs` | `node sealos-footprint.mjs --namespace <ns> --app <app>` | Read-only inventory of Instance/App/workloads/Jobs/KubeBlocks/PVCs for deploy debug and cleanup planning |
| `sealos-live-smoke.mjs` | `node sealos-live-smoke.mjs --url <url> [--captcha-path <path>] [--login-method json-token\|cookie-json] [--login-path <path>] [--username <user>] [--password <pass>] [--auth-path <path>]` | Read-only or credentialed HTTP smoke test for the real Sealos App entry URL |
| `sealos-log-scan.mjs` | `node sealos-log-scan.mjs --namespace <ns> --app <app> [--since 10m] [--tail 300] [--baseline <report.json\|json>] [--min-window-seconds 60]` | Read-only JSON scan of Pod/init/main logs plus Warning Event convergence after readiness, login, and random 404 checks |
| `sealos-auth.mjs` | `node sealos-auth.mjs check\|login\|list\|switch` | Sealos Cloud authentication & workspace switching |

All scripts output JSON. Run via Bash and parse the result.

For public web applications, run `sealos-launchpad-network.mjs` before HTTP smoke. Acceptance requires `ok: true`, an open public network, the expected Service port, and an App URL host match. The script emits an allowlisted network summary and excludes raw Launchpad application data, environment variables, Secrets, and kubeconfig content.

Runtime Event acceptance uses two scans. Capture the first report after readiness with no baseline, wait at least 60 seconds, then pass that report through `--baseline` for the final scan. Extend `--min-window-seconds` to cover one full known reconciliation, probe, or scheduled-work period. An initial Warning Event is an observation; a Warning that advances after the baseline, an unresolved referenced Secret, a Ready transition, a Pod replacement, or a restart delta is an active failure.

For intentional fault injection, retain a pre-injection report as evidence. After recovery reaches Ready, capture a fresh recovery baseline and compare the final scan against that recovery baseline after the full stability window.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Action | Skip When |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 0 — Preflight | Capability scan, path-specific warnings, Sealos auth | Initial blockers resolved |
| 0.4 — Eligibility | Confirm the repository root is a supported cloud workload | Any non-eligible result → stop |
| 0.5 — Template Fast Path | Match GitHub repo to a configured Sealos template | No match, or match cannot materialize template YAML |
| 1 — Assess | Clone repo (or use current project), analyze deployability | Score too low → stop |
| 2 — Detect | Find existing image (Docker Hub / GHCR / README) | Found → jump to Phase 5 |
| 3 — Dockerfile | Generate Dockerfile if missing | Already has one → skip |
| 4 — Build & Push | `docker buildx` → GHCR (auto via gh CLI) or Docker Hub (fallback) | — |
| 5 — Template | Generate Sealos application template | — |
| 5.5 — Configure | Guide user through app env vars and inputs | No inputs needed |
| 6 — Deploy | Deploy template to Sealos Cloud | — |
| 6.5 — Runtime Truth Pass | Verify Launchpad public networking, the actual Sealos runtime, logs, Event convergence, App URL, login path, object-storage flow, and resource footprint | User explicitly requests deploy-only output |

```

**Execution rule:** Phase 1 must never start while Phase 0 still has unresolved entry blockers. Docker, `gh`, builder, and registry failures must be reported early, but only become hard blockers if the run later requires local build/push.
