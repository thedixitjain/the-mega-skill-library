Use 'Azure MCP/documentation' tool to find the minimal role definition that matches the desired permissions the user wants to assign to an identity (If no built-in role matches the desired permissions, use 'Azure MCP/extension_cli_generate' tool to create a custom role definition with the desired permissions). Use 'Azure MCP/extension_cli_generate' tool to generate the CLI commands needed to assign that role to the identity and use the 'Azure MCP/bicepschema' and the 'Azure MCP/get_bestpractices' tool to provide a Bicep code snippet for adding the role assignment.
