# SIGCOMM Experiments

Use this before submission when the evaluation is not yet locked. At SIGCOMM the experiments are
where a mechanism is believed or disbelieved, and the reviewer culture reads a setup for
realism, fairness, and honesty about where the mechanism breaks.

## Experiment audit

- Map each performance claim to a specific microbenchmark, testbed run, trace replay,
  deployment measurement, or documented break point.
- Choose **baselines that fight back**: the strongest deployed alternative, tuned fairly, not a
  straw man the mechanism was built to beat.
- **Report the distribution.** Give the relevant percentiles (P50, P99, and the tail that
  hurts) with variance over repeated trials, and hold the fair variable — throughput, offered
  load, fairness — fixed while you compare.
- Document the setup completely: topology, buffer sizes, workload or trace and its provenance,
  parameters, environment versions, run counts, and seeds.
- Map the **break point**: the workload or condition where the mechanism degrades to the
  baseline. A paper that never shows where its idea stops working invites the reviewer to
  assume it stops everywhere interesting.
- Audit for leakage between motivation and evaluation, unrepresentative traffic, and any
  mismatch between the claimed operating regime and the one actually tested.

## The evidence ladder

| Rung | Evidence | What it proves | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Microbenchmark | Isolated mechanism in a controlled setup | The mechanism does what the principle claims | Says nothing about real traffic |
| Testbed / emulation | Real switches or a faithful emulator under a workload | Behavior under contention and topology | Scale and workload realism bounded |
| Trace replay | A production or representative trace driving the testbed | Behavior under realistic traffic structure | Trace provenance must be defensible |
| Deployment | The mechanism in real operation | It survives the messy real world | Hard to isolate cause; strongest evidence |

Climb as high as the contribution's claim requires. A fabric or transport claim generally needs
at least testbed-plus-trace evidence; simulation-only or mean-only results read as
under-evaluated for such claims.

## What experiments are for here

```text
Not: "we beat every baseline on average across many workloads"
But: "under the traffic that causes the pain we measured, this mechanism
      cuts the tail that hurts, at matched throughput, and here is exactly
      where it stops helping."
```

One decisive experiment under the workload that motivated the paper outweighs five extra
datasets that never stress the mechanism.

## Vignette: evaluating a routing mechanism

A paper proposes backlog-aware rerouting. The matching plan: a microbenchmark showing the
rerouting reacts at the intended timescale; a testbed replaying a production RPC trace to show
the tail-FCT win at matched throughput; sweeps over incast ratio and buffer size to show the
win is not a single-point artifact; and an adversarial workload that removes flowlet gaps to map
the break point where the mechanism degrades to ECMP — each result tied to a numbered claim.

## Output format

```text
[Evaluation readiness] strong / adequate / weak
[Claim -> evidence map] <claim: microbenchmark / testbed / trace / deployment>
[Baseline check] <strongest deployed alternative, tuned fairly? yes/no>
[Tail reporting] <percentiles + variance + matched fair variable>
[Break point] <where the mechanism degrades, and to what>
[Decision-critical next run] <one experiment>
```
