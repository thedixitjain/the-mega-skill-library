# Transparency & Data Policy (poq-transparency-and-data-policy)

POQ has two transparency demands that distinguish it from generic social-science venues: **AAPOR-standard
methodological disclosure** of every survey, and a **replication package** that reproduces exactly all
published tables and figures, archived in **POQ's Dataverse before the paper advances to typesetting**.
Build both as you go so acceptance does not stall.

## When to trigger

- Assembling **Appendix A: Disclosure Elements** for every dataset reported
- Building the replication/reproduction package for POQ's Dataverse
- A manuscript was accepted and the office requested materials before typesetting
- Data cannot be fully shared (privacy, ethics, provider restrictions) and you need the exemption path

## AAPOR disclosure — Appendix A: Disclosure Elements

POQ requires manuscripts to **disclose these elements for all data reported (if applicable) or link to
publicly available / published documentation**, gathered in an **"Appendix A: Disclosure Elements"**:

1. **Funding** — who sponsored the data collection.
2. **Exact question wording** of all survey questions used.
3. **Population under study** — a clear description.
4. **Sample design** — frame, selection, stratification, clustering.
5. **Method and dates of data collection** — mode(s) and field period.
6. **Response rate and how it was calculated** — per **AAPOR Standard Definitions** (state RR1–RR6 and
   show the disposition-code computation).
7. **Sample sizes and a discussion of the precision** of the findings.
8. **Design effect due to clustering and weighting** — discuss the adjustment.

For secondary data, **link to the public documentation** rather than reproducing it.

## Replication package — POQ Dataverse (Harvard)

1. **Deposit to POQ's Dataverse** on Harvard Dataverse (the journal's permanent archive with
   persistent identifiers) — not a personal website or generic cloud link.
2. **Reproduce exactly** all published tables and figures: data + code + documentation sufficient to
   regenerate every reported result. Master script + README + pinned versions + seeds.
3. **Archived before typesetting** — accepted manuscripts do not advance until materials are in place.
4. **Data Availability Statement (DAS)** in the article's endmatter describing where/how to access the
   data.

## When data cannot be shared (exemption path)

- **Explain why** the data are restricted (privacy, ethics, provider/legal limits).
- Provide **README instructions on exactly how others can obtain the data** (access process, contact).
- Where possible, provide **synthetic data** so the code can be run.
- A **twelve-month embargo** from the article's appearance may be requested (confirm current terms — 待核实).

## Build-as-you-go checklist

- [ ] **Appendix A** drafted with all eight disclosure elements (or links) for every dataset
- [ ] Response rate stated **with AAPOR definition + calculation**
- [ ] One **master script** regenerates **every** table and figure
- [ ] **README** + provenance + **seeds** + **pinned versions**
- [ ] Exhibit numbers in the manuscript **match** package output exactly
- [ ] **Data Availability Statement** drafted for the endmatter
- [ ] Restricted data: exemption note + access path + synthetic data + embargo request if needed

## Anti-patterns

- A response rate with no AAPOR definition or calculation (an Appendix A failure)
- Treating the deposit as a post-publication afterthought (it gates typesetting)
- Code that does not actually reproduce the printed tables/figures
- A personal URL instead of POQ's Dataverse
- Claiming data are restricted without an access path or synthetic substitute

## Output format

```
【Appendix A】all 8 disclosure elements present (or linked)? [Y/N]
【Response rate】AAPOR definition + calculation shown? [Y/N]
【Repository】POQ Dataverse (Harvard) — package staged? [Y/N]
【Reproduces tables/figures?】master script verified locally? [Y/N]
【Documentation】README + provenance + seeds + pinned versions? [Y/N]
【DAS】drafted for endmatter? [Y/N]
【Restricted data?】exemption + access path + synthetic + embargo?
【Next】poq-review-process
```
