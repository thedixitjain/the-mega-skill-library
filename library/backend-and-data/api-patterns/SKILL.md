## ✅ Decision Checklist

Before designing an API:

- [ ] **Asked user about API consumers?**
- [ ] **Chosen API style for THIS context?** (REST/GraphQL/tRPC)
- [ ] **Defined consistent response format?**
- [ ] **Planned versioning strategy?**
- [ ] **Considered authentication needs?**
- [ ] **Planned rate limiting?**
- [ ] **Documentation approach defined?**

---

## ❌ Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Default to REST for everything
- Use verbs in REST endpoints (/getUsers)
- Return inconsistent response formats
- Expose internal errors to clients
- Skip rate limiting

**DO:**
- Choose API style based on context
- Ask about client requirements
- Document thoroughly
- Use appropriate status codes
