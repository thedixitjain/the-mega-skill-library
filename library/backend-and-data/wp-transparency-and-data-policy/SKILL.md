# Transparency & Data Policy (wp-transparency-and-data-policy)

World Politics has a **Dataverse archive**, and **authors who rely on quantitative data must deposit**
their materials there **after a piece is accepted but prior to publication**. The deposited file must
let others **replicate the exact numerical results**. Build the package as you go so acceptance does
not stall.

## When to trigger

- Building the replication package for a quantitative or mixed-method paper
- A manuscript has been **accepted** and you must deposit before publication
- Original/proprietary data require an **embargo** and you need the approval path
- Documenting qualitative/comparative-historical sources for transparency

## What World Politics requires (verify current wording on the policy page)

1. **Deposit to the World Politics Dataverse.** After acceptance and **before publication**, authors
   relying on quantitative data place materials in this trusted digital repository — not a personal
   site or generic cloud link.
2. **What to include.** The original data; specialized computer programs; lists of program recodes;
   extracts of existing data files; and — most importantly — an **explanatory file (README)** that
   describes what is in the data, how it was created, the sources it was drawn from, and **how to
   replicate the exact numerical results**.
3. **State availability in the article.** The published piece must indicate where/how the data are
   available.
4. **Embargoes.** Embargoes on original, proprietary data for **up to two years** beyond publication
   (or other special circumstances) may be granted, but require **editorial-committee approval before
   publication**. Junior scholars collecting original data for other projects may request longer.

## Qualitative & comparative-historical transparency
- Document the **evidentiary basis**: which archival documents, interviews, or fieldnotes support which
  inferential step. Evidence tables and active citation (ATI) make process-tracing claims auditable.
- Use access-controlled repositories (e.g., QDR) where sensitivity or human-subjects concerns require
  it; reconcile with the **APSA Principles and Guidance for Human Subjects Research** (see
  `wp-review-process`).

## Build-as-you-go checklist

- [ ] One **master script** regenerates **every** table and figure from raw/constructed data
- [ ] **README** documents contents, construction, sources, and how to replicate exact results
- [ ] **Seeds** set and reported for every stochastic step
- [ ] Software/package **versions pinned** (`renv.lock` / `requirements.txt` / recorded installs)
- [ ] Exhibit numbers in the manuscript **match** the package output exactly
- [ ] Data-availability statement drafted for the article
- [ ] Embargo (if any) justified and slated for **editorial-committee approval** before publication
- [ ] Qualitative sources documented (evidence tables / access-controlled repository where needed)

## Anti-patterns

- Treating the deposit as optional when the paper relies on quantitative data (it is required)
- Depositing code that does not reproduce the published numbers
- A personal URL instead of the World Politics Dataverse
- Assuming an embargo without editorial-committee approval
- Undocumented, un-seeded, unpinned code that "works on my machine"

## Replication-objection patterns and the venue-specific fix

The deposit is checked against the published numbers, so the failures here are about reproducibility
and provenance rather than design.

| Objection at deposit/replication | The fix this skill drives |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| "Code doesn't reproduce the published table" | One master script that regenerates every exhibit; match numbers exactly |
| "Stochastic step won't replicate" | Set and report seeds for bootstrap, randomization, sampling |
| "Provenance unclear" | README documenting sources, construction, recodes, and replication steps |
| "Proprietary data can't be shared" | Request an editorial-committee-approved embargo (up to two years) before publication |
| "Qualitative claims unauditable" | Evidence tables / active citation; access-controlled repository where sensitivity requires |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A hypothetical accepted paper on **trade agreements and democratic backsliding** stages its package:

```text
Master script: make.R → regenerates Tables 1–4 + Figures 1–3 from /raw and /derived
Seeds:         set.seed(20260601) before the bootstrap in model 3
Versions:      renv.lock pins R 4.x + 18 packages
Provenance:    README maps V-Dem v14 + DESTA to each constructed variable
Embargo:       one proprietary firm-survey extract → 2-year embargo, committee approval requested
Check:         a clean-machine run reproduces every published number before deposit
```

The clean-machine run is the gate; "works on my machine" is not deposit-ready. (The Dataverse,
embargo, and timing rules are policy that can change — confirm against the current data-policy page.)

## Output format

```
【Repository】World Politics Dataverse — package staged? [Y/N]
【Reproduces exact results?】master script verified locally? [Y/N]
【Documentation】README + provenance + seeds + pinned versions? [Y/N]
【Data-availability statement】drafted for the article? [Y/N]
【Embargo?】needed? justified for editorial-committee approval?
【Qualitative transparency】evidence/sources documented? [Y/N/NA]
【Next】wp-review-process
```
