# Replication Package (ecta-replication-package)

## When to trigger

- You are preparing the deposit required under the Data and Code Availability Policy
- Monte Carlo tables cannot be regenerated bit-for-bit from a clean checkout
- An empirical paper has no documented data provenance or access path
- You are at acceptance / final-files stage and the Data Editor will verify reproducibility

Econometrica (and the other Econometric Society journals) enforce a **single ES-wide Data and
Code Availability Policy**. Concrete, Econometrica-specific specifics that differ from the
AER/AEJ (AEA Data Editor + openICPSR) pipeline:

- The policy applies to papers with **empirical, experimental, and/or simulation** results.
  A **pure-theory paper with no such results is effectively exempt** — but any requested
  exemption or limitation on data/code availability must be stated **at initial submission**
  (the handling Co-Editor decides; exemptions are not considered later).
- Reproducibility is verified **before final acceptance** by the **Econometric Society Data
  Editor** team. In practice you submit final files at **Conditional Acceptance** to a
  separate Editorial Express account for the Data Editor's checks and correspondence.
- The package must include a **README in PDF**; the Social Science Data Editors' README
  template is recommended and covers every required item.
- For packages **conditionally accepted after July 1, 2023**, the replication package is
  deposited at the **Econometric Society Journals' Community at Zenodo** (you may reserve a
  DOI in advance). Another trusted open repository with a permanent DOI can satisfy the
  requirement with Data Editor approval — but **not** the AEA/openICPSR route by default.

Verify the *current* policy text and deposit location on the official ES Data Editor site
before finalizing — the specifics evolve.

> Build the package as you go, not the night before final files. A package assembled from
> memory at the end almost never reproduces — and here a real human Data Editor will run it.

## What the package must contain

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Code | All scripts that produce every table, figure, and number in the paper *and* Supplemental Material |
| Master script | One command (`run_all`) regenerates every exhibit end to end |
| Random seeds | Every stochastic step seeded and recorded, so Monte Carlo tables reproduce bit-for-bit (simulations are covered by the ES policy) |
| Environment | Software, version numbers, and pinned dependencies (Docker / `renv` / `conda` / `Project.toml`) |
| README (PDF) | Hardware, expected runtime, data sources, file-by-file description, exhibit ↔ script map; use the Social Science Data Editors' README template |
| Data (empirical) | The data, or — when proprietary/restricted — exact provenance and an access path that lets a replicator obtain it |
| Deposit | The Econometric Society Journals' Community at **Zenodo** (after the Data Editor's checks; reserve a DOI in advance), unless a trusted DOI repository is approved |
| License / terms | Any data-use restrictions documented; redistribution rights respected |

## Reproducibility discipline for Monte Carlo

- **Seed everything** and record the seed alongside each table. Re-running must reproduce the
  exact numbers, not merely "similar" ones.
- **Master script** runs all simulations and writes outputs to named files that map to table
  numbers.
- **Runtime honesty.** State how long the full simulation takes and on what hardware; if it is
  days, provide a smaller smoke-test path that runs quickly and a way to verify the full run.
- **No manual steps.** No "then copy the number into the table by hand" — exhibits should be
  generated programmatically where feasible.

## Empirical data provenance

- **Public data:** include it (or a script that downloads a fixed version) plus the citation.
- **Proprietary / restricted data (e.g., licensed firm-level, confidential admin data):** you
  generally cannot redistribute it. Document the exact source, version, access procedure,
  required licenses/fees, and contact, so a replicator can obtain the *same* data. Provide all
  code, and where allowed, a synthetic or example dataset that exercises the pipeline.
- **Confidentiality:** strip personal identifiers; respect data-provider agreements; state any
  approvals obtained.

## Recommended structure

```
replication/
  README.md            # provenance, environment, runtime, exhibit↔script map
  run_all.{do,R,py,jl} # master script: one command rebuilds everything
  code/                # numbered scripts (setup → simulate/estimate → tables → figures)
  data/                # public data or a synthetic example; provenance for restricted data
  output/              # generated tables/figures (regenerable, not hand-edited)
  env/                 # Dockerfile / renv.lock / environment.yml / Project.toml
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Every table, figure, and number (paper + Supplemental Material) regenerated by code
- [ ] Single master script reproduces everything end to end
- [ ] Every random draw seeded; Monte Carlo tables reproduce bit-for-bit (simulations are in-scope)
- [ ] Environment pinned (versions + dependencies)
- [ ] README in **PDF** (Social Science Data Editors' template) documents hardware, runtime, data sources, and exhibit↔script map
- [ ] Public data included or downloaded by script with a fixed version
- [ ] Restricted data: provenance + access path documented; synthetic example provided if allowed
- [ ] Any exemption/limitation requested **at initial submission** (theory paper with no empirical/experimental/simulation results may be exempt)
- [ ] Deposit plan: Econometric Society Journals' Community at **Zenodo** (DOI reserved); Data Editor checks pass at conditional acceptance
- [ ] Confidentiality and data-use terms respected; identifiers removed
- [ ] Verified against the *current* ES Data and Code Availability Policy and Data Editor site

## Anti-patterns

- Unseeded simulations, so tables only reproduce "approximately"
- A pile of scripts with no master file and undocumented run order
- Numbers transcribed into tables by hand, untraceable to any script
- "Data available on request" with no provenance, version, or access procedure
- An environment that only runs on the author's machine (unpinned versions)
- Redistributing proprietary data in violation of the license
- Leaving package assembly to the final-files deadline

## Output format
