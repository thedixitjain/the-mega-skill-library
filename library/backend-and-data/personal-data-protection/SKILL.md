This skill helps engineers ship features that comply with personal-data-protection statutes in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is organised by **where in the stack the obligation lives** rather than by statute section number — engineers shouldn't need to learn statute references to do their job.

## Step 1 — Identify the active jurisdiction(s)

**On first use in a project, check for `.pdp-compliance.json` at the project root.** If present, use `personalDataProtection.jurisdictions` and load only the matching `jurisdictions/<code>/README.md` files. If absent, ask the user which jurisdiction(s) apply. The answer depends on where the application's users are located, not where the company is registered.

> *"Which personal-data-protection regimes does this application need to comply with? Pick all that apply: Singapore (PDPA 2012), Indonesia (UU PDP 27/2022), Thailand (PDPA B.E. 2562), Malaysia (PDPA 2010 with 2024 Amendments), Philippines (DPA / RA 10173). If users span multiple jurisdictions, pick all relevant — the strictest rule will usually win."*

Once selected, suggest creating `.pdp-compliance.json` in the project root so future sessions and local guardrails do not need to re-ask:

```json
{
  "personalDataProtection": {
    "jurisdictions": ["sg-pdpa"],
    "mode": "strictest-wins",
    "reviewPolicy": "warn"
  }
}
```

Then load only the relevant `jurisdictions/<code>/README.md` files. Cross-jurisdiction comparison lives in [`jurisdictions/_index.md`](jurisdictions/_index.md).

| Code | Jurisdiction | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `sg-pdpa` | Singapore PDPA 2012 (post-2020 Amendments) | ✅ populated |
| `th-pdpa` | Thailand PDPA B.E. 2562 (2019) | ✅ populated |
| `id-pdp` | Indonesia UU PDP No. 27/2022 | ✅ populated |
| `my-pdpa` | Malaysia PDPA 2010 (with 2024 Amendments — Act A1727) | ✅ populated |
| `ph-dpa` | Philippines Data Privacy Act 2012 (RA 10173) | ✅ populated |
| `vn-pdpd` | Vietnam PDP Decree 13/2023/ND-CP | 🚧 planned for v0.5 (deferred — full PDP Law in draft) |

Once the user has chosen, persist that choice in `.pdp-compliance.json` when the project allows file changes. If the project cannot accept that file, persist the choice somewhere project-specific (a comment in the project's `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent project-instruction file) so subsequent sessions don't need to re-ask.

## Step 2 — Pick the right entry point

**You're starting work on something.** Open the matching checklist:

| Task | Checklist |
|---|---|
| Adding or modifying a feature that touches personal data | [`checklists/new-feature.md`](checklists/new-feature.md) |
| Adding a column / field that holds personal data | [`checklists/new-data-field.md`](checklists/new-data-field.md) |
| Adding a third-party SDK or vendor that will process personal data | [`checklists/new-vendor.md`](checklists/new-vendor.md) |
| Responding to a security incident | [`checklists/breach-response.md`](checklists/breach-response.md) |

**You want depth on a specific layer.** Open the matching layer file:

| Layer | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [01 Non-technical](layers/01-non-technical.md) | DPO, staff acceptable-use, vendor contracts, complaint handling |
| [02 Architecture](layers/02-architecture.md) | Data residency, isolation, encryption, secret handling, defence-in-depth |
| [03 Data model](layers/03-data-model.md) | Consent records, audit records, retention markers, deletion conventions, PII inventory |
| [04 Controls and processes](layers/04-controls-and-processes.md) | Access control, retention sweeps, log hygiene, breach detection signals |
| [05 Feature / UX](layers/05-feature-ux.md) | Signup consent, settings, account deletion, data export, primer dialogs, EXIF strip |
| [06 Disclosure](layers/06-disclosure.md) | Privacy policy, T&C, OS permission strings, contextual notices |
| [07 Operational](layers/07-operational.md) | Incident response, retention sweeps, backups, vendor reviews, monitoring |

Layer files are **universal across all populated jurisdictions** — implementation patterns are shared. Jurisdiction-specific obligations live in `jurisdictions/<code>/obligations/`.

## Critical thresholds (commit to memory)

These vary by jurisdiction — the active one(s) determine which apply.

| | Singapore PDPA | Thailand PDPA | Indonesia UU PDP | Malaysia PDPA | Philippines DPA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Breach notification window to authority | **3 calendar days** after assessing as notifiable (s26D(1)) | **72 hours** from awareness (s37(4)) | **72 hours** from awareness — to **both** subject AND regulator (Pasal 46(1)) | **72 hours** from discovery to Commissioner (s12B(1) + JPDP Guideline 25 Feb 2025); **7 days** post-Commissioner to affected subject | **72 hours** from knowledge / reasonable belief — to **both** NPC AND affected subject (§ 38 IRR + NPC Circular 16-03 § 12) |
| Significant-scale / risk threshold | ≥ 500 affected individuals | "Risk to rights and freedoms"; "high risk" triggers individual notification | Always notify subject; "certain circumstances" trigger public notification (Pasal 46(3)) | "Significant harm" triggers subject notification (s12B(2)) — no fixed scale threshold | Information-type-driven: SPI or identity-fraud-enabling info, acquired by unauthorised person, real risk of serious harm (NPC Circular 16-03 § 11); ≥ 100 persons triggers § 35 penalty aggravation |
| Maximum financial penalty cap | SGD 1M / 10% SG turnover (s48J(3)) | THB 1M / 3M / 5M tiered (s82–84); plus criminal up to 1 year + THB 1M (s79) | **2% of annual revenue per violation** (Pasal 57(3)); plus corporate criminal — fines up to 10× + suspension / **dissolution** (Pasal 70) | **RM 1M / 3 years per principle breach** (s5(2), raised by A1727 from RM 300k / 2y); per-offence not turnover-based; offences stack | **₱5M / 6 years** for combination or series (§ 33); **₱4M / 6 years** for SPI offences (§§ 25(b), 26(b)); ≥ 100 persons triggers maximum-period aggravation (§ 35) |
| Individual criminal liability | Yes (s48D/E/F) — SGD 5,000 / 2 years | Yes (s79–81); s81 catches director / manager **omissions**, broader than SG | Yes (Pasal 67–68): up to 6 years + IDR 6B; corporate liability extends to dissolution (Pasal 70(4)) | Yes (s130 unlawful collecting RM 500k / 3y); **s133 deeming liability** for directors / managers unless they prove no-knowledge + due-diligence defence | Yes — **§ 34 makes responsible officers personally liable** for the prison terms of corporate offences (in addition to the corporate fine); **§ 30 concealment is its own offence** (1.5–5 years + ₱500k–₱1M) |

## How to use the layer ↔ obligation split

The pattern is **implement once, check against multiple jurisdictions**.

A new-feature checklist run looks like:
1. Identify what personal data the feature touches.
2. Walk the universal `layers/` to plan the implementation (data model, access controls, UX, disclosure, operational).
3. For each active jurisdiction, walk `jurisdictions/<code>/obligations/` to verify the implementation satisfies the statute-level obligations. Note where multiple jurisdictions disagree — usually the strictest rule controls.
4. Update the project's privacy policy / consent records / runbook as needed.

## Statute version

Each jurisdiction's `README.md` records:
- Which version of the statute the obligation files reflect
- When the content was last verified against official sources
- Pending amendments to watch for

When statutes amend, this skill is updated and tagged. See the upstream [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) and pin to a version if you need stability.
