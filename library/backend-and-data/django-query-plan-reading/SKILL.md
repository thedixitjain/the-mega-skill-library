# Django Query Plan Reading

Use this skill when the expensive unit is a specific SQL statement or queryset. The goal is to explain why the database is doing work, not to guess from the ORM code.

## Workflow

1. Get the exact query.
   - Prefer the queryset that produced it.
   - If starting from logged SQL, include bound parameters or representative literals.

2. Generate a plan.
   - Use `queryset.explain()` for ORM-owned SQL.
   - Use database `EXPLAIN` for raw SQL, views, materialized views, or SQL copied from logs.
   - Use `analyze=True` only in a safe environment because the database executes the query.

3. Read from the deepest node outward.
   - Identify table scans, index scans, joins, sorts, aggregations, and limits.
   - Compare estimated rows with actual rows when using analyze.
   - Look for high-cost nodes that feed many rows to later nodes.

4. Decide the next change.
   - Missing selective access path: use `django-index-design`.
   - Query shape prevents useful index access: rewrite filters, ordering, or join strategy.
   - Large unavoidable aggregation: consider `django-db-side-computation` or `django-materialized-views`.
   - Deep offset cost: use `django-pagination-performance`.

5. Re-run the same plan after the change.
   - Compare scan type, row counts, sort nodes, heap fetches, buffers, planning time, and execution time.

See [explain-checklist.md](references/explain-checklist.md) for plan-reading cues and before/after review notes.

## Safety Notes

- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes the query. Avoid it for mutations, unsafe functions, and production paths unless you know the impact.
- A sequential scan is not automatically bad. It can be best when the table is small or the predicate returns much of the table.
- A used index is not automatically good. Random heap access, bad cardinality estimates, or a post-index sort can still dominate.

## Verification

Finish with the before/after plan excerpt and a plain explanation of which node changed and why that matters.
