# REStud Replication Package (restud-replication-package)

## When to trigger

- A conditional acceptance arrived and the Data Editor's reproducibility check is coming
- Drafting the README at any point (recommended: from day one of the project)
- Auditing reproducibility before submitting the deposit
- A prior deposit was returned for incomplete provenance or non-running code

## REStud's actual data & code availability policy

REStud has a **Data Editor** (Miklós Koren; verified 2026-05-30) and follows the **AEA Data and Code Availability Standard (DCAS)**, the same standard the AEA journals and Econometric Society use. Its defining feature, which differs from journals that merely "encourage sharing": the Data Editor runs a **reproducibility check on the data and code before the paper is published** — the code is actually executed to confirm it reproduces the reported results, and publication is conditional on passing. Accepted papers' replication packages are **deposited at Zenodo** (the journal's / Society's Zenodo community), where the package receives a DOI; you may reserve the DOI in advance and finalize after the check. **Exemptions exist for confidential / proprietary / restricted data** — notify the editors *at submission* — but even then you must provide the **code plus a clear description of how to obtain the data**. Authors may also be asked for materials at the review stage if a referee or editor requests it. Exact forms, repository, and timing **change — verify on https://www.restud.com/submissions/ and the REStud Data Editor site (https://restud.github.io/data-editor/before/) before depositing.**

## README required sections

1. **Overview** — what the package does, which paper, software required.
2. **Data availability and provenance** — for every dataset: source (URL/institution), citation, license/terms, date accessed, whether included and if not, why. Restricted data: commit to ≥ 5-year preservation, assist reasonable requests, make code public, document access fully.
3. **Dataset list** — table: Filename | Description | Source | Notes.
4. **Computational requirements** — OS, software versions, packages, runtime, peak memory.
5. **Description of programs** — what each script does and the run order; name the master script.
6. **Instructions to replicators** — literal step-by-step from a clean state.
7. **List of tables/figures → programs** — map every published exhibit to the script and line that produces it (this is exactly what the Data Editor reruns).

## Coding discipline (adopt from day one)

- **One master script** runs the whole pipeline end-to-end — the Data Editor will run it on a clean machine.
- **Relative paths only** — never `/Users/yourname/...`.
- **Set the random seed** explicitly in any stochastic step.
- **Version-pin packages**: Stata `version 18.0` + a setup do-file; R `renv`; Python `requirements.txt` with `==` pins.
- **Log files** for every run.
- For structural/theory-empirical papers: deposit the estimation code, the solver/optimizer settings, and the counterfactual code; document convergence criteria and starting values.

## Checklist

- [ ] Master script runs from a clean state on a different machine (mirrors the Data Editor's check)
- [ ] All paths relative; random seeds set
- [ ] Software and package versions documented and pinned
- [ ] README covers every dataset's provenance
- [ ] Every published table/figure mapped to its producing script and line
- [ ] Restricted data: provenance + runnable code + synthetic-data smoke test where possible
- [ ] Files visible in the repository, not hidden behind one opaque ZIP
- [ ] Package laid out to the **AEA DCAS** template (README + data + code + DCAS-style data-availability statement)
- [ ] Zenodo deposit drafted / DOI reserved
- [ ] Current REStud Data Editor forms and policy verified on the official page

## Anti-patterns

- Waiting until acceptance to start the deposit — the pre-publication check delays papers that fail it
- "Data available from the authors upon request" — does not satisfy REStud's policy
- A README written for collaborators rather than for an unknown replicator (or the Data Editor)
- Hardcoded absolute paths; unpinned packages; a master script that errors on a clean machine
- Depositing summary tables but not the code that produced the regressions
- Assuming the deposit is just a courtesy upload — at REStud it is *verified by execution* (DCAS check by the Data Editor) before publication
- Treating proprietary data as a pass on the deposit — code and an access description are still required, and the editors must be told at submission

## Output format

```
【DEPOSIT TYPE】public-data | restricted-data | hybrid
【README STATUS】complete / incomplete
【REPRODUCIBILITY CHECK】self-tested clean / not yet (Data Editor reruns before publication)
【STRUCTURAL CODE INCLUDED】yes / n/a
【POLICY VERIFIED ON OFFICIAL PAGE】yes / no
【NEXT SKILL】restud-referee-strategy | restud-submission
```
