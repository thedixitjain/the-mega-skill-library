# Data Analysis (ajs-data-analysis)

At AJS the analysis exists to make the **theoretical claim credible** — not to display technique. A
generalist, double-blind reviewer will ask whether the evidence actually warrants the claim and whether
candor about uncertainty is present. This skill stress-tests the analysis chain in the idiom of your
work.

## When to trigger

- Planning the analysis, or auditing it before writing up
- A reader doubts robustness, the evidence-to-claim link, or the handling of uncertainty
- Reconciling multiple methods or data sources into one coherent argument
- Deciding which analyses are confirmatory vs. exploratory

## Analysis norms (by tradition)

### Quantitative
- Report **uncertainty honestly** (intervals, not just stars); avoid implying causality the design
  cannot support.
- Show that results are **not artifacts**: principled robustness (alternative specifications,
  samples, measures), not a fishing expedition; keep seeds and pinned versions.
- Distinguish **preregistered/confirmatory** from **exploratory** analyses where applicable.

### Comparative-historical
- Make the **inferential logic** explicit (necessary/sufficient conditions, sequence, conjuncture);
  show how disconfirming evidence was sought and weighed.
- Cite primary sources so a reader could follow the trail.

### Ethnographic / interview
- Show the **analytic procedure**: how codes/themes were built, how negative cases were handled, how
  representativeness within the case is judged.
- Quote enough to let the reader assess the inference from data to claim.

## Triangulation (an AJS strength)

AJS often rewards **convergent evidence** — a mechanism shown through more than one window
(e.g., statistics + cases, or interviews + administrative data). When methods disagree, say so and
theorize the discrepancy rather than hiding it.

## Referee-pushback patterns on the evidence chain (AJS fixes)

At a theory-forward generalist journal the analysis is judged by whether it makes the *claim* credible, not by technical novelty:

| Referee writes… | The AJS-specific fix |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| "Robustness theater." | run the one check the mechanism hinges on; drop filler |
| "Mechanism under-theorized." | map each estimate to an implication from `ajs-theory-building` |
| "Causal language the design can't bear." | restate as descriptive/associational and theorize it |
| "Methods disagree, unexplained." | theorize the discrepancy, don't suppress a window |

## Calibration (AJS appetite, hedged)

Orienting heuristics; confirm against the journal's current submission guidelines. AJS rewards convergent evidence and candor over a dense methods display, judging each tradition by its own standard; where a parsimony-first sibling prizes one clean estimate, AJS often prizes a mechanism shown through more than one window. Illustrative: a paper claims a mentoring program narrows a promotion gap "by building cross-rank ties" (an illustrative 6-point reduction, 95% CI ~2–10). A referee writes "the mechanism is asserted, not shown." The fix maps it to an observable implication (mentees gain cross-rank ties), triangulates with an illustrative 24 interviews, reports two units where the gap did *not* close, and softens causal phrasing to "consistent with."

## Execution bridge (StatsPAI / Stata MCP)

Run the battery, don't just enumerate it. Full map:
[`execution-with-mcp`](../../../shared-resources/empirical-methods/execution-with-mcp.md). AJS is general sociology with a strong theory tradition; apply the chain below to its quantitative-empirical lane.

- **Many outcomes / specifications:** `romano_wolf` (step-down FWER) or
  `benjamini_hochberg` — report the adjusted threshold.
- **OVB sensitivity:** `oster_delta` / `sensemakr`.
- **Inference:** `wild_cluster_bootstrap` (few clusters), `twoway_cluster` / `conley`;
  multilevel data → cluster at the right level.
- **Re-fit off one handle:** `audit_result(result_id)` lists the missing checks and the
  exact `suggest_function` for each.
- **Exhibits:** `etable` / `did_summary_to_latex` from the handle — no retyped numbers.

Keep the decisive checks in the body and the exhaustive battery in the supplement. See
the executed chain in the [JF execution walkthrough](../../../Journal-of-Finance-Skills/resources/worked-examples/02-execution-walkthrough.md).
## Anti-patterns

- Stars-only reporting; implying causation from association
- Robustness theater (a wall of tables that never tests the load-bearing assumption)
- Cherry-picked quotes or cases that ignore negative evidence
- Presenting exploratory results as if confirmatory
- Technique foregrounded over the theoretical question it serves
- A single-window analysis where triangulation was feasible and would have settled the mechanism


## Evidence pass for American Journal of Sociology

Treat this skill as an executable review pass, not a prose hint. First lock the social process, data leverage, causal or interpretive warrant, and theoretical payoff; then judge whether the current manuscript answers the venue's real reader: sociology reviewers who value deep theory, durable empirical leverage, and careful social-mechanism claims.

- **Do the pass:** Audit the research design before polishing prose: unit of analysis, comparison set, uncertainty, sensitivity, missingness, and reproducibility must be visible.
- **Return a ledger:** give `claim / evidence / risk / manuscript location` rows, so the next agent can edit rather than rediscover the issue.
- **Sibling guard:** compare against ASR for broader empirical sociology, Social Forces for wider substantive range, Demography for population mechanisms; if a sibling owns the contribution, recommend re-routing before polishing format.
- **Stop condition:** do not give submission-ready advice until the pack's `resources/official-source-map.md` has been checked for volatile rules and the manuscript has one concrete fix for the largest venue-specific risk.
