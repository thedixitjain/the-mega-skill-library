# Documentation Review Criteria

## Critique Dimensions

### 1. Classification Accuracy

Verify type assignment against DIVIO decision tree.

Questions: Do cited signals support assigned type? | Contradicting signals ignored? | Confidence appropriate? | Decision tree leads to same classification?

Verification: 1) Run decision tree independently 2) Check positive signals present 3) Check for red flags 4) Verify confidence matches signal strength

Severity: if wrong classification leads to wrong verdict = blocking.

### 2. Validation Completeness

Verify all type-specific criteria checked. Questions: All items checked? | Pass/fail correct? | Issues properly located? | Any criteria missed?

**Tutorial** (required): completable without external refs | steps numbered/sequential | verifiable outcomes | no assumed knowledge | builds confidence

**How-to** (required): clear goal | assumes fundamentals | single task | completion indicator | no basics teaching

**Reference** (required): all params documented | return values | error conditions | examples | no narrative

**Explanation** (required): addresses "why" | context/reasoning | alternatives considered | no task steps | conceptual model

### 3. Collapse Detection Correctness

Verify all five anti-patterns checked with accurate findings.
- Tutorial creep: explanation >20% | How-to bloat: teaching basics | Reference narrative: prose in entries
- Explanation task drift: steps in explanation | Hybrid horror: 3+ quadrants

Verification: independently scan, count lines per quadrant, compare to documentarist's findings, flag discrepancies.

### 4. Recommendation Quality

Criteria: **Specific** (exact what/where) | **Actionable** (author knows next step) | **Prioritized** (important first) | **Justified** (why it matters) | **Root cause** (underlying issue)

Bad: "Improve the documentation", "Make it clearer"
Good: "Move explanation in section 3.2 (lines 45-60) to separate doc", "Add return value docs for login()"

### 5. Quality Score Accuracy

Verify six characteristics: Accuracy (factual claims verified?) | Completeness (gap analysis thorough?) | Clarity (Flesch 70-80?) | Consistency (style 95%+?) | Correctness (errors counted?) | Usability (structural assessment?)

Note: Documentarist cannot fully measure accuracy (needs expert) or usability (needs user testing). Verify limitations properly scoped.

### 6. Verdict Appropriateness

Verify verdict matches findings per decision matrix below.

## Severity Framework

| Level | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Blocking | Wrong classification/verdict, missed collapse making doc unusable | Must fix |
| High | Multiple criteria missed, collapse missed but usable | Should fix; may block |
| Medium | Single criterion missed, miscalibrated confidence, false positive | Recommended |
| Low | Format inconsistency, wording clarity | Optional |

**Reject**: any blocking | 3+ high | classification wrong | verdict contradicts findings
**Conditionally approve**: 1-2 high not affecting verdict | multiple medium but core correct
**Approve**: no blocking/high | medium noted but not blocking

## Verdict Decision Matrix

- **Approved**: all checks pass or low-only failures | no collapse | quality gates met (Flesch 70-80, purity 80%+)
- **Needs Revision**: medium/low failures only | no collapse | fixable without restructuring
- **Restructure Required**: collapse detected | purity <80% | multiple user needs | requires splitting

### Verification Algorithm
1. Count issues by severity 2. Check collapse_detection.clean 3. Check quality gates 4. Apply matrix 5. Compare to documentarist verdict 6. Flag discrepancy
