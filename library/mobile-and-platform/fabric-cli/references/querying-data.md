# Querying Data

How to query semantic models in DAX and lakehouses, warehouses, or SQL databases in SQL.

## Querying the SQL endpoint: route priority

For T-SQL against a Lakehouse SQL endpoint, Warehouse, or SQL Database:

1. **`fabric-sql` MCP server** ; the hosted Fabric SQL endpoint MCP. The most convenient route: zero local setup (no `sqlcmd`, no DuckDB, no Spark), runs server-side, returns CSV. Reach for it first when ergonomics matter and the tool is loaded. See [Fabric SQL Endpoint MCP](#fabric-sql-endpoint-mcp-convenient-route) below.
2. **`sqlcmd`** ; [`scripts/query_sql_endpoint.py`](../scripts/query_sql_endpoint.py). The fastest and most reliable route in practice; reuses `az login`. Prefer it for speed, for scripted/repeated queries, or whenever the MCP is unavailable, and when you need flags the MCP doesn't expose (`-o` file output, `GO`-separated scripts, severity filtering).
3. **DuckDB over OneLake** ; [`scripts/query_lakehouse_duckdb.py`](../scripts/query_lakehouse_duckdb.py). Reads the Delta files directly from OneLake (not the SQL endpoint). Use to bypass the endpoint's metadata sync lag, join across lakehouses in different workspaces, or use DuckDB-only functions.
4. **PySpark** ; `nb exec code`. Spark SQL on Fabric compute (not the SQL endpoint). Use when you need to write back to Delta, run distributed transforms, or use Delta features (time travel, OPTIMIZE, VACUUM); the session cold start makes it by far the slowest for ad-hoc reads.

Tradeoff: the MCP wins on convenience but adds a gateway hop over the same TDS endpoint `sqlcmd` uses, and is in **preview** ; it can intermittently fail (e.g. `Could not obtain activation parameters`) and is not the fastest. When latency or reliability matters, `sqlcmd` is the safer default.

DAX against a semantic model is a separate path (queries the model, not the table); see [Query a Semantic Model (DAX)](#query-a-semantic-model-dax).

## Fabric SQL Endpoint MCP (convenient route)

The hosted `fabric-sql` MCP server (`microsoft.fabric.sqlEndpoint`, preview) executes T-SQL against any Fabric item that exposes a SQL endpoint (Lakehouse, Warehouse, SQL Database). It runs entirely server-side, so there is nothing to install locally and no `abfss://` path or host discovery to do. Register it as an `http` server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope project fabric-sql \
  https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/mcp/dataPlane/sqlEndpoint
```

That writes a `mcpServers.fabric-sql` entry into a project-root `.mcp.json`; you can author that file by hand instead, with the same URL and the bearer header shown under Authentication below. After adding it, approve and authenticate the server on the next `claude` start, then the `execute_query` tool is available in-session.

### Endpoint and tool

```
url:  https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/mcp/dataPlane/sqlEndpoint   (global)
tool: execute_query(workspaceId, itemId, query)  ->  CSV resource
```

- `workspaceId` ; the workspace GUID (`fab get "ws.Workspace" -q "id"`)
- `itemId` ; the GUID of the SQL-capable item. For a Lakehouse, either the Lakehouse GUID (`fab get "ws.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" -q "id"`) or its SQL endpoint GUID (`...-q "properties.sqlEndpointProperties.id"`) works
- `query` ; the T-SQL text; results come back as an embedded CSV resource plus a row-count line

The global URL needs `workspaceId` and `itemId` on every call. An item-scoped URL variant exists (`.../dataPlane/workspaces/<wsId>/items/<itemId>/sqlEndpoint`) but it still requires the same arguments, so the global URL is the better shared default.

### Authentication

The endpoint uses Entra OAuth on the Power BI scope (`https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default`).

**Use a bearer header.** Claude Code's interactive `/mcp` OAuth does **not** work here: the SDK tries RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, which Entra refuses, and auth fails with *"Incompatible auth server: does not support dynamic client registration."* Instead, export a Power BI token into the environment before launching Claude Code and reference it from the server's `headers` (token in env only, never written to disk):

```bash
export FABRIC_PBI_TOKEN="$(az account get-access-token --resource https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api --query accessToken -o tsv)"
```

```json
"fabric-sql": {
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/mcp/dataPlane/sqlEndpoint",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${FABRIC_PBI_TOKEN}" }
}
```

The token expires after ~1 hour; re-export and restart Claude Code to refresh. For a self-refreshing alternative, register a dedicated Entra public-client app and pass its `--client-id` / `--callback-port` to `claude mcp add` so the SDK skips dynamic registration and does auth-code + PKCE against it.

### Quirks

- First call against a cold workspace can return `Could not obtain activation parameters for workspace`; retry once after a few seconds.
- The Lakehouse SQL endpoint is read-only (same constraint as `sqlcmd`); the tool advertises a destructive hint because Warehouse and SQL Database endpoints accept writes.
- Same metadata sync lag as `sqlcmd`: a table written via Spark may take 10-60s to appear in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`. Force it with [refreshMetadata](#force-the-sql-endpoint-metadata-sync-skip-the-sleep) instead of sleeping.

## Wrapper scripts (fallback)

Three Python scripts in `scripts/` wrap the raw `fab api` / `duckdb` / `sqlcmd` invocations and handle path resolution, ID lookup, host discovery, auth, and output formatting for you. Prefer them over hand-rolled commands unless you need a feature they don't expose.

- **DAX against a semantic model** ; [`scripts/execute_dax.py`](../scripts/execute_dax.py): resolves workspace and model IDs, posts to `executeQueries`, and formats results as table/csv/json.
- **Delta over OneLake (lakehouse / warehouse)** ; [`scripts/query_lakehouse_duckdb.py`](../scripts/query_lakehouse_duckdb.py): resolves workspace and lakehouse IDs, builds the `abfss://` path, shells out to `duckdb` with the `delta` and `azure` extensions preloaded, and strips the `CREATE SECRET` preamble noise from the output.
- **T-SQL over any SQL-capable item** ; [`scripts/query_sql_endpoint.py`](../scripts/query_sql_endpoint.py): detects item type (Lakehouse, Warehouse, SQLDatabase), resolves the SQL host via the right property path, and invokes `sqlcmd --authentication-method ActiveDirectoryAzCli`. See [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md) for full argument reference.

The sections below explain the raw commands these scripts wrap ; use them when you need to extend, debug, or understand what the scripts do.

## Query Lakehouse or Warehouse Data with DuckDB

DuckDB can query Delta Lake tables and raw files directly from OneLake using the `delta` and `azure` core extensions. This is the fastest way to explore, validate, and analyze lakehouse data without creating a semantic model. For routine single-table queries, prefer [`scripts/query_lakehouse_duckdb.py`](../scripts/query_lakehouse_duckdb.py); the raw form is documented below for reference and for multi-table joins or `Files/` raw-file reads.

### Prerequisites

- DuckDB installed (`brew install duckdb` on macOS)
- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login`); the same session used by `fab`

### Setup

```sql
INSTALL delta;
INSTALL azure;
```

### Querying Delta Tables

Delta tables in a lakehouse are stored at `Tables/<schema>/<table>`. Query them with `delta_scan()`:

```bash
# Query a delta table using friendly names (recommended)
duckdb -c "
LOAD delta; LOAD azure;
CREATE SECRET (TYPE azure, PROVIDER credential_chain, CHAIN 'cli');

SELECT * FROM delta_scan(
  'abfss://my-workspace@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/MyLH.Lakehouse/Tables/schema/table_name'
) LIMIT 10;
"
```

The `CHAIN 'cli'` parameter tells the azure extension to use Azure CLI credentials; without it, DuckDB tries managed identity first (which fails on local machines).

**Note:** The `.Lakehouse` suffix is required when using friendly names. For tables in the default `dbo` schema, GUID-based paths also work (see [OneLake Path Format](#onelake-path-format)).

### Querying Raw Files

Files stored under `Files/` can be queried directly by format:

```bash
BASE="abfss://${WS_ID}@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/${LH_ID}/Files"

duckdb -c "
LOAD azure;
CREATE SECRET (TYPE azure, PROVIDER credential_chain, CHAIN 'cli');

-- CSV files
SELECT * FROM read_csv('${BASE}/data/sales.csv') LIMIT 10;

-- JSON files
SELECT * FROM read_json('${BASE}/exports/report.json') LIMIT 10;

-- Parquet files
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('${BASE}/warehouse/facts.parquet') LIMIT 10;

-- Glob pattern: read all JSON files in a directory tree
SELECT count(*) FROM read_json('${BASE}/2025/01/*/activity_*.json');
"
```

Supported formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet. Glob patterns (`*`, `**`) work for reading multiple files at once.

### OneLake Path Format

OneLake supports two path formats: **friendly names** and **GUIDs**.

```
# Friendly names (recommended for schema tables)
abfss://<workspace-name>@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/<item-name>.<ItemType>/Tables/<schema>/<table>

# GUIDs
abfss://<workspace-id>@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/<item-id>/Tables/<schema>/<table>
```

**IMPORTANT: Use friendly names for schema-namespaced tables.** The GUID format fails with "Bad Request" when reading parquet files from schema subfolders (e.g., `Tables/bronze/orders`). Friendly names work reliably for all table paths including nested schemas.

```bash
# GUID format -- works for dbo tables, FAILS for schema tables
WS_ID=$(fab get "ws.Workspace" -q "id" | tr -d '"')
LH_ID=$(fab get "ws.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" -q "id" | tr -d '"')
delta_scan('abfss://${WS_ID}@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/${LH_ID}/Tables/dbo/my_table')          # OK
delta_scan('abfss://${WS_ID}@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/${LH_ID}/Tables/bronze/my_table')       # FAILS

# Friendly name format -- works for ALL tables including schemas
delta_scan('abfss://my-workspace@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/MyLH.Lakehouse/Tables/bronze/my_table')  # OK
delta_scan('abfss://my-workspace@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/MyLH.Lakehouse/Tables/dbo/my_table')     # OK
```

| Item type | Friendly name format | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Lakehouse | `abfss://ws@onelake.../LH.Lakehouse/Tables/...` | Direct Delta tables |
| Warehouse | `abfss://ws@onelake.../WH.Warehouse/Tables/...` | Direct Delta tables |
| SQL Database | `abfss://ws@onelake.../DB.SQLDatabase/Tables/...` | Auto-mirrored Delta; ~15s replication delay; extra `MSSQL_System_Uniquifier` column |

Cross-item joins work in a single DuckDB query; use different `abfss://` paths for each item.

### Common Use Cases

#### Data freshness check

```sql
-- Find the most recent records in a table
SELECT max(date_column) as latest_date, count(*) as total_rows
FROM delta_scan('abfss://.../<lh-id>/Tables/gold/orders');
```

#### Data quality validation

```sql
-- Check for nulls, duplicates, and value distributions
SELECT
  count(*) as total,
  count(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE amount IS NULL) as null_amounts,
  min(order_date) as earliest,
  max(order_date) as latest
FROM delta_scan('abfss://.../<lh-id>/Tables/silver/orders');
```

#### Schema discovery for semantic model design

```sql
-- Explore column names, types, and sample values before building a model
DESCRIBE SELECT * FROM delta_scan('abfss://.../<lh-id>/Tables/gold/customers');

-- Profile a table to understand cardinality and distributions
SELECT
  column_name,
  column_type,
  count,
  approx_count_distinct,
  null_percentage
FROM (SUMMARIZE delta_scan('abfss://.../<lh-id>/Tables/gold/customers'));
```

#### Cross-table joins without a semantic model

```sql
-- Join multiple lakehouse tables directly
SELECT o.order_date, c.customer_name, sum(o.amount) as total
FROM delta_scan('.../Tables/gold/orders') o
JOIN delta_scan('.../Tables/gold/customers') c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### Row count audit across schemas

```sql
SELECT 'gold.orders' as tbl, count(*) as rows FROM delta_scan('.../Tables/gold/orders')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'gold.customers', count(*) FROM delta_scan('.../Tables/gold/customers')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'silver.orders', count(*) FROM delta_scan('.../Tables/silver/orders')
ORDER BY tbl;
```

### Limitations

- **Read-only**: DuckDB reads Delta tables but cannot write back (append-only writes exist but are not recommended for lakehouse tables)
- **Auth**: Requires Azure CLI login or service principal; does not work with Fabric-only tokens
- **Path format matters**: Use friendly names (not GUIDs) for tables in non-default schemas; see [OneLake Path Format](#onelake-path-format)

## sqlcmd Over Lakehouse, Warehouse, and SQL Database

Every Fabric Lakehouse exposes a read-only T-SQL endpoint, every Warehouse and SQL Database is fully T-SQL native, and all three accept the same `sqlcmd` invocation. When the table you need is already surfaced through the SQL endpoint, `sqlcmd` is often simpler than DuckDB (no `abfss://` path construction, no Azure extension setup, full T-SQL including `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, `sys.*`, CTEs, window functions) and simpler than PySpark (no session warmup, no notebook plumbing).

For routine queries, prefer [`scripts/query_sql_endpoint.py`](../scripts/query_sql_endpoint.py); it auto-detects item type, resolves the SQL host, and handles all of the flag plumbing below. The raw-`sqlcmd` walkthrough that follows explains what the script does under the hood and is worth reading before you extend it.

The pattern below reuses your existing `az login` session via the `ActiveDirectoryAzCli` authentication method. No password, no service principal, no token file ; `sqlcmd` reads the token straight from the `az` cache.

### Prerequisites

- `sqlcmd` (go-sqlcmd, v1.9.0 or later): `brew install sqlcmd` or `winget install --id Microsoft.Sqlcmd`
- `az login` with an identity that has at least `Viewer` on the workspace and `Read` on the SQL-side object
- `fab auth login` for endpoint discovery

### Discover the SQL endpoint

Fabric stores the SQL host under a different property depending on item type:

```bash
# Lakehouse SQL endpoint host (resolves to <id>.datawarehouse.pbidedicated.windows.net)
fab get "ws.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" -q "properties.sqlEndpointProperties.connectionString"

# Warehouse host (resolves to <id>.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com)
fab get "ws.Workspace/WH.Warehouse" -q "properties.connectionString"

# SQL Database host
fab get "ws.Workspace/SQLDB.SQLDatabase" -q "properties.serverFqdn"
```

The database name to pass to `sqlcmd -d` is the item's display name without the type extension (e.g. `LH` for `LH.Lakehouse`).

### Query a lakehouse table

```bash
SQL_HOST=$(fab get "ws.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" -q "properties.sqlEndpointProperties.connectionString" | tr -d '"')

sqlcmd -S "$SQL_HOST" -d LH \
  --authentication-method ActiveDirectoryAzCli \
  -W -s "|" \
  -Q "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM dbo.orders"
```

Output:

```
OrderID|CustomerID|OrderDate|Amount
-------|----------|---------|------
1001|42|2024-03-15|199.50
1002|17|2024-03-15|83.20
...

Statement ID: {...} | Query hash: 0x... | Distributed request ID: {...}
(10 rows affected)
```

Fabric appends a `Statement ID | Query hash | Distributed request ID` footer to every successful query; use those values when opening a Fabric support ticket or correlating with `queryinsights.exec_requests_history`.

### Query a warehouse

Identical pattern, different property name for the host:

```bash
SQL_HOST=$(fab get "ws.Workspace/WH.Warehouse" -q "properties.connectionString" | tr -d '"')

sqlcmd -S "$SQL_HOST" -d WH \
  --authentication-method ActiveDirectoryAzCli \
  -W -s "|" \
  -Q "SELECT schema_name(schema_id) AS schema_name, name FROM sys.tables"
```

### Query a SQL Database

```bash
SQL_HOST=$(fab get "ws.Workspace/SQLDB.SQLDatabase" -q "properties.serverFqdn" | tr -d '"')

sqlcmd -S "$SQL_HOST" -d SQLDB \
  --authentication-method ActiveDirectoryAzCli \
  -W -s "|" \
  -Q "SELECT name FROM sys.objects WHERE type = 'U'"
```

### Useful sqlcmd flags

- `-W` ; strip trailing whitespace. Without this every column is padded to its max declared length and wraps off-screen; it is the single most important flag.
- `-s "|"` ; column separator. Pipe or tab works better than spaces for downstream parsing.
- `-h -1` ; suppress repeating column headers between result blocks.
- `-y 0 -Y 0` ; disable column truncation for `varchar(max)` / `nvarchar(max)`.
- `-o out.tsv` ; write to a file instead of stdout.
- `-Q "..."` ; run one query and exit (vs `-q` which keeps the session open).
- `-i query.sql` ; read SQL from a file; useful for multi-statement scripts with `GO` separators.
- `-b` ; return a non-zero exit code if any statement fails; essential inside CI/CD.
- `-m 11` ; only print error messages with severity >= 11 (suppresses DBCC / informational noise).

### Query a schema at once

The Fabric SQL endpoint supports `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` and `sys.*` metadata views, which DuckDB does not. Use them to explore a lakehouse without guessing table names:

```bash
sqlcmd -S "$SQL_HOST" -d LH \
  --authentication-method ActiveDirectoryAzCli \
  -W -s "|" \
  -Q "SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA NOT IN ('sys','INFORMATION_SCHEMA') ORDER BY TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME"
```

### Lakehouse SQL endpoint quirks

- **Read-only**: the Lakehouse SQL endpoint does not support `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `CREATE TABLE`. Use DuckDB, PySpark, or Warehouse T-SQL for writes.
- **Lag behind OneLake**: the SQL endpoint has its own metadata sync. A table created via Spark may take 10-60 seconds to appear in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`; if you just wrote and a query fails with `Invalid object name`, either force the sync (below) or, when you don't need `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`/`sys.*`, read the Delta files directly with DuckDB over OneLake, which has no such lag.
- **Schemas are case-sensitive**: `dbo.Orders` and `dbo.orders` are different objects if the underlying Delta path uses mixed case. Always confirm with `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`.
- **Three-part names work within the same endpoint** (`<database>.<schema>.<table>`); four-part cross-endpoint queries do not.

### Force the SQL endpoint metadata sync (skip the sleep)

Rather than sleeping through the 10-60s lag after a Spark write, force the SQL analytics endpoint to sync. This is a documented GA endpoint:

```
POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/sqlEndpoints/{sqlEndpointId}/refreshMetadata
body (optional): {"recreateTables": false}
```

- `{sqlEndpointId}` is the **SQL endpoint** id, not the lakehouse id: `fab get "ws.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" -q "properties.sqlEndpointProperties.id"`.
- Long-running: a `200` returns per-table `TableSyncStatuses` (`Success`/`Failure`/`NotRun`) synchronously; a `202` returns a `Location` header to poll.

```bash
WS=$(fab get "ws.Workspace" -q "id" | tr -d '"')
SQLEP=$(fab get "ws.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" -q "properties.sqlEndpointProperties.id" | tr -d '"')
fab api "workspaces/$WS/sqlEndpoints/$SQLEP/refreshMetadata" -X post -i '{"recreateTables": false}'
```

Use this when a job just wrote a table and a downstream step must read it through the SQL endpoint immediately. If you don't need `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`/`sys.*`, DuckDB over OneLake sidesteps the endpoint (and the lag) entirely -- see [Query Lakehouse or Warehouse Data with DuckDB](#query-lakehouse-or-warehouse-data-with-duckdb).

### When to use the MCP vs sqlcmd vs DuckDB vs PySpark

- **`fabric-sql` MCP**: the table is reachable through the SQL endpoint and the server is loaded/authenticated. Most convenient (no local tooling, runs server-side), but a gateway hop over `sqlcmd`'s TDS and in preview ; reach for it for ergonomics, not for speed or reliability. See [Fabric SQL Endpoint MCP](#fabric-sql-endpoint-mcp-convenient-route).
- **sqlcmd**: the same T-SQL niche as the MCP and faster/more reliable in practice. First choice for speed, scripted/repeated queries, anything you'd paste into SSMS, or when you need its file output / `GO` scripts / severity filtering.
- **DuckDB**: you need to read Delta files directly (bypass the SQL endpoint sync lag), join across lakehouses in different workspaces, or use DuckDB-specific functions (`PIVOT`, `UNPIVOT`, `read_json_auto`). See [Query Lakehouse or Warehouse Data with DuckDB](#query-lakehouse-or-warehouse-data-with-duckdb).
- **PySpark**: you need to write back to Delta, run distributed transforms on large tables, use Delta-specific features (time travel, OPTIMIZE, VACUUM), or call the Fabric runtime's pre-installed libraries. See [Execute PySpark/Python Directly Against a Lakehouse](#execute-pysparkpython-directly-against-a-lakehouse-no-notebook).

## Execute PySpark/Python Directly Against a Lakehouse (No Notebook)

Run arbitrary PySpark or Python code on Fabric Spark compute without creating a notebook. Useful for ephemeral ETL, one-off transforms, data validation, or agent-driven compute that doesn't need a persistent artifact. Full read/write access to lakehouse Delta tables via Spark SQL.

### Using `nb exec code` (Recommended)

The `nb` CLI (`cargo install nb-fabric`) wraps the full session lifecycle: create, wait, submit, poll, print, and cleanup. Sessions are always cleaned up, even on errors.

```bash
# Python (default)
nb exec code "MyWorkspace/MyLH.Lakehouse" "print('hello')"

# PySpark (includes Spark context for SQL and DataFrames)
nb exec code "MyWorkspace/MyLH.Lakehouse" "spark.sql('SHOW TABLES').show()"

# Pipe code via stdin
echo "spark.sql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gold.orders').show()" | nb exec code "WS/LH.Lakehouse" -

# Multi-line code
nb exec code "MyWorkspace/MyLH.Lakehouse" "
df = spark.sql('SELECT category, COUNT(*) as n FROM products GROUP BY category ORDER BY n DESC')
df.show()
df.write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable('product_summary')
print('Done')
"
```

Output goes to stdout; status and metadata go to stderr:

```
---- exec: PySpark ----
  Creating session...
  Waiting for idle...  (session a1b2c3d4)
  Session ready.
  Submitting code...
<your output here>
  Session cleaned up.
---- result ----
  session  a1b2c3d4-...
  runtime  PySpark
  duration 25.3s
  status   ok
```

Exit code is non-zero when the submitted code fails, so agents can check `$?`.

### Using the API Directly

For programmatic use without the `nb` CLI, call the Fabric REST API directly.

#### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login`)
- A lakehouse in the target workspace

#### How it works

1. **Create a session** against a lakehouse (provisions Spark compute)
2. **Submit code statements** one at a time; poll for results
3. **Read output** from the statement response (`output.data["text/plain"]`)
4. **Delete the session** when done

**CRITICAL: Always delete sessions when done.** Idle sessions consume Fabric capacity units (CUs). A forgotten session burns compute until it times out (default: 20 minutes idle). In a loop or automation, wrap session cleanup in a `finally` block.

#### Authentication

The API requires a token from `az account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com`. Tokens from `fab auth` do **not** work for storage access; the Fabric Token Manager rejects them for OneLake operations.

```python
import subprocess, json

result = subprocess.run(
    ["az", "account", "get-access-token", "--resource", "https://api.fabric.microsoft.com"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
token = json.loads(result.stdout)["accessToken"]
```

#### API Endpoints

```
Base: https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{wsId}/lakehouses/{lhId}/livyapi/versions/2023-12-01

POST   /sessions                      Create session (kind: "pyspark")
GET    /sessions/{id}                 Check state (poll until "idle")
POST   /sessions/{id}/statements      Submit code
GET    /sessions/{id}/statements/{n}  Get result (poll until state: "available")
DELETE /sessions/{id}                 Delete session (always do this)
```

#### Example: Query and Transform

```python
import json, time, urllib.request

WS_ID = "<workspace-id>"
LH_ID = "<lakehouse-id>"
BASE = f"https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{WS_ID}/lakehouses/{LH_ID}/livyapi/versions/2023-12-01"

def api(path, method="GET", body=None):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    data = json.dumps(body).encode() if body else None
    req = urllib.request.Request(f"{BASE}{path}", data=data, method=method, headers=headers)
    resp = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
    raw = resp.read().decode()
    return json.loads(raw) if raw else {}

# 1. Create session
session = api("/sessions", "POST", {"kind": "pyspark"})
session_id = session["id"]

try:
    # 2. Wait for idle
    while api(f"/sessions/{session_id}").get("state") != "idle":
        time.sleep(5)

    # 3. Submit code
    code = '''
    df = spark.sql("SELECT category, COUNT(*) as n, ROUND(AVG(price),2) as avg_price FROM products GROUP BY category")
    df.show()
    df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("product_summary")
    print("Done")
    '''
    stmt = api(f"/sessions/{session_id}/statements", "POST", {"code": code, "kind": "pyspark"})

    # 4. Poll for result
    while True:
        result = api(f"/sessions/{session_id}/statements/{stmt['id']}")
        if result.get("state") == "available":
            output = result["output"]
            if output["status"] == "ok":
                print(output["data"]["text/plain"])
            else:
                print(f"Error: {output['evalue']}")
            break
        time.sleep(5)

finally:
    # 5. ALWAYS clean up
    api(f"/sessions/{session_id}", "DELETE")
```

### What works

- `spark.sql("SELECT ...")` -- full Spark SQL against lakehouse tables
- `spark.sql("SHOW TABLES")` -- metastore access
- `df.write.saveAsTable(...)` -- write Delta tables back to the lakehouse
- JDBC reads from external SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.
- Pure Python (pandas, numpy, pyarrow, etc.)
- In-memory Spark DataFrames

### Limitations

- `deltalake` (delta-rs) is not pre-installed in the PySpark runtime; use Spark SQL instead
- `notebookutils` APIs have limited functionality (no FUSE mount, no `/lakehouse/default/`)
- Session startup takes 30-90 seconds (cold start); subsequent statements are fast
- Tokens expire after ~60 minutes; long-running sessions need token refresh

### When to use each approach

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Quick read-only exploration | DuckDB (fastest; no Spark overhead) |
| Write data back to lakehouse | `nb exec code` or notebook |
| Ephemeral transform; no persistent artifact | `nb exec code` |
| Complex multi-cell workflow with debugging | Notebook (`nb exec` or portal) |
| Scheduled ETL | Notebook via `fab job run` |
| Agent-driven compute (Dagster, orchestrators) | `nb exec code` or API directly |

## Query a Semantic Model (DAX)

DAX queries run against semantic models via the Power BI API. This is the standard approach for querying modeled data; measures, calculated columns, relationships, and RLS are all applied.

### SUMMARIZECOLUMNS (Preferred)

`SUMMARIZECOLUMNS` is the preferred function for querying semantic models. It groups by columns, adds extension columns (measures or expressions), and accepts filter arguments.

```
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS (
    <GroupBy_Column> [, <GroupBy_Column> [, ...]],
    [<FilterTable> [, <FilterTable> [, ...]]],
    ["<Name>", <Expression> [, "<Name>", <Expression> [, ...]]]
)
```

- **GroupBy columns**: Column references like `'Table'[Column]` to group by
- **Extension columns**: Named columns prefixed with `@`; paired as `"@Name", <Expression>`
- **Filter arguments**: Table expressions that restrict results; use `TREATAS` to apply filter values from outside the model

Rows where all extension columns evaluate to BLANK are automatically excluded.

### Escaping in DAX via fab API

DAX queries are embedded inside a JSON string passed to `fab api`. This creates two layers of escaping:

| Character | In DAX | Escaped in JSON string |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| Single quote `'` | `'Table'[Column]` | `'\''Table'\''[Column]` (break out of bash single-quote) |
| Double quote `"` | `"@ExtCol"` | `\"@ExtCol\"` (escaped for JSON) |

The safest approach is to write the JSON payload to a temp file:

```bash
WS_ID=$(fab get "ws.Workspace" -q "id" | tr -d '"')
MODEL_ID=$(fab get "ws.Workspace/Model.SemanticModel" -q "id" | tr -d '"')

cat > /tmp/dax-query.json << 'DAXEOF'
{
  "queries": [{
    "query": "EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( 'Date'[Year], 'Product'[Category], \"@TotalSales\", [Total Sales], \"@AvgPrice\", AVERAGE ( 'Product'[UnitPrice] ) )"
  }],
  "serializerSettings": { "includeNulls": false }
}
DAXEOF

fab api -A powerbi "groups/$WS_ID/datasets/$MODEL_ID/executeQueries" \
  -X post -i /tmp/dax-query.json
```

### Filtering with TREATAS

Apply ad-hoc filters without needing a relationship by using `TREATAS` as a filter argument:

```json
{
  "queries": [{
    "query": "EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( 'Date'[Year], 'Customer'[Region], \"@Revenue\", [Total Revenue], \"@Orders\", COUNTROWS ( 'Sales' ), TREATAS ( { \"Europe\", \"Asia\" }, 'Customer'[Region] ) )"
  }]
}
```

### Inline (without temp file)

For simple queries, inline works; escape `"` as `\"` inside the JSON:

```bash
fab api -A powerbi "groups/$WS_ID/datasets/$MODEL_ID/executeQueries" \
  -X post -i "{\"queries\":[{\"query\":\"EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( 'Date'[Year], \\\"@Total\\\", [Total Sales] )\"}]}"
```

### Helper script

```bash
python3 scripts/execute_dax.py "ws.Workspace/Model.SemanticModel" \
  -q "EVALUATE SUMMARIZECOLUMNS ( 'Date'[Year], \"@Total\", [Total Sales] )"
```

For full DAX query patterns, parameters, and troubleshooting, see [semantic-models.md](./semantic-models.md).

## Query a Lakehouse Table via Direct Lake (Alternative)

When DuckDB is not available, create a temporary Direct Lake semantic model to query lakehouse tables via DAX:

```bash
# 1. Create Direct Lake model from lakehouse table
python3 scripts/create_direct_lake_model.py \
  "src.Workspace/LH.Lakehouse" \
  "dest.Workspace/Model.SemanticModel" \
  -t schema.table

# 2. Query via DAX
python3 scripts/execute_dax.py "dest.Workspace/Model.SemanticModel" -q "EVALUATE TOPN(10, 'table')"

# 3. (Optional) Delete temporary model (recovery depends on tenant Item Recovery setting)
fab rm "dest.Workspace/Model.SemanticModel" -f
```

For lakehouse properties, endpoints, and file/table operations, see [lakehouses.md](./lakehouses.md).
