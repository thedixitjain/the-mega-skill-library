# PDF Monster

## Core Rule

Treat PDF files as source artifacts that must be converted into model-readable evidence before analysis. Do not create `output/`, `analysis/`, `pages/`, or similar folders in the user's working directory unless the user explicitly asks to save extracted artifacts.

Use the bundled `scripts/analyze_pdf.py` first. Resolve this path from the skill root, not from the user's current working directory. It prints JSON to stdout, extracts text in-place, and writes only image artifacts to an OS temporary directory unless `--save-to` is provided.

## Quick Start

Run from this skill directory or replace `scripts/analyze_pdf.py` with its absolute path:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --json
```

When the agent is running from another directory, use the absolute installed path. In Claude Code, `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` points at this skill directory:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --json
```

## Setup

Python 3 is required. Before first use, check whether PyMuPDF is already available:

```bash
python3 -c "import fitz"
```

If that fails and the agent is allowed to run pip/network installs, install the recommended dependency from this skill's `requirements.txt`. In Claude Code:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/requirements.txt"
```

In other agents, use the absolute path to this skill's `requirements.txt`.

If dependency installation is not allowed, continue with the script anyway; it can use Poppler fallbacks when available. Optional system tools improve coverage when PyMuPDF is unavailable or OCR is needed, but do not install system packages automatically:

- Poppler: `pdfinfo`, `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`, `pdfimages`
- Tesseract: `tesseract` plus any needed language data, such as `eng` or `kor`

For visual-heavy or scanned documents:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --render-pages all --ocr auto --json
```

For Korean/English OCR, use Tesseract language data and pass:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --render-pages all --ocr auto --ocr-lang kor+eng --json
```

For text-only inspection with no temporary image artifacts:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --render-pages none --no-extract-images --ocr never --json
```

For slide decks or PDFs with repeated logos/icons, reduce embedded image noise while keeping page renders available:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --render-pages all --min-image-area 10000 --dedupe-images --json
```

For selected pages:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --pages 1,3-5 --render-pages all --json
```

Persist artifacts only when the user asks for reusable files:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py path/to/file.pdf --save-to ./pdf-monster-artifacts --json
```

## Reading Workflow

1. Run `analyze_pdf.py` and capture stdout JSON.
2. Check `warnings`, `page_count`, `artifact_root`, `pages_needing_visual_review`, and each page's `text_chars`, `ocr_text_chars`, `render_path`, `embedded_images`, `needs_visual_review`, and `visual_review_reasons`.
3. Use `text` as the primary evidence when it is complete enough.
4. Inspect `ocr_text` when a page has little extracted text or appears scanned.
5. Open `render_path` for pages marked `needs_visual_review`, and for pages where layout, charts, handwriting, equations, tables, screenshots, or visual placement could change the answer.
6. Open `embedded_images[].path` when the PDF contains standalone figures that may be clearer than the page render.
7. Cite page numbers from the manifest when answering.
8. Delete temporary artifacts after finishing if `artifact_policy` is `temporary`.

The JSON includes a `cleanup_command` such as:

```bash
rm -rf -- /tmp/pdf-monster-...
```

Run it only after the image paths are no longer needed. Never delete a `--save-to` directory unless the user asks.

## Finalization Checklist

Before answering, complete these checks:

- If `pages_needing_visual_review` is non-empty, inspect the relevant `render_path` or rerun selected pages with `--render-pages all` before making claims that depend on layout, diagrams, tables, or figures.
- If rendered pages or extracted images were created with `artifact_policy: temporary`, run `cleanup_command` after the visual evidence is no longer needed.
- Cite page numbers for document claims. If the evidence is incomplete because OCR or rendering is unavailable, say that clearly.
- Do not expose names, student IDs, email addresses, signatures, or other personal data in summaries unless the user specifically asks for that information.
- Do not paste raw JSON, temporary artifact paths, or long extracted text into the final answer unless the user asks for those details.

## Script Behavior

`analyze_pdf.py` prefers PyMuPDF when available. It falls back to Poppler CLI tools where possible:

- `pdftotext` for text extraction
- `pdfinfo` for page count
- `pdftoppm` for page renders
- `pdfimages` for embedded image extraction
- `tesseract` for OCR when installed

OCR is optional. If `tesseract` is missing, report the missing OCR capability and continue with text extraction and rendered page images.

## Other Agent Use

Install this folder where the agent discovers skills, or reference the absolute path in custom instructions:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/pdf-monster` or `.claude/skills/pdf-monster`
- Codex: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/pdf-monster` or `~/.codex/skills/pdf-monster`
- Pi Coding Agent: `~/.pi/agent/skills/pdf-monster`, `~/.agents/skills/pdf-monster`, or a `skills` settings entry
- OpenClaw: `~/.openclaw/skills/pdf-monster`, `<workspace>/skills/pdf-monster`, or `skills.load.extraDirs`
- Hermes Agent: `~/.hermes/skills/pdf-monster` or `skills.external_dirs`

For agents without a native skill loader, give them this folder and a short instruction:

```text
Use pdf-monster/SKILL.md. For PDF tasks, run:
python3 /absolute/path/to/pdf-monster/scripts/analyze_pdf.py <pdf> --json
Read the JSON from stdout. Use temporary image paths only while analyzing, then clean them up.
Do not create output folders in the user's working directory unless explicitly asked.
```

For OpenCode or similar agents, keep the repository checked out somewhere stable and reference the absolute path to `SKILL.md` or `scripts/analyze_pdf.py` in the agent's custom instructions. The only hard requirement is Python 3. PyMuPDF is the recommended dependency; Poppler and Tesseract improve fallback and OCR coverage.
