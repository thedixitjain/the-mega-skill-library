# Creating Power BI Reports

Create and scaffold Power BI reports using `pbir` CLI. Install with `uv tool install pbir-cli` or `pip install pbir-cli`. Load the `pbir-cli` and `pbi-report-design` skills alongside this one.

## Vague or Underspecified Prompts

When the user's request lacks specific measures, audience context, structural preferences, or formatting direction (e.g., "make me a dashboard", "create something with KPIs"), consult **`references/vague-prompts.md`** before proceeding. Close the gap between intent and specification with targeted questions; then apply sensible defaults (sqlbi theme, executive dashboard pattern, model-driven KPI selection) for anything the user can't or won't specify.

## Rules

- Visuals must not overlap one another
- Favor theme changes over visual overrides for static formatting
- Favor extension measures with theme colors (like "bad") for conditional formatting
- Always create reports inside a named project folder (e.g., `sales-dashboard/Sales.Report`)
- Run `pbir validate` after every mutation
- New reports already include the **sqlbi** theme -- do NOT run `pbir theme apply-template` unless the user explicitly asks for a different theme
- New reports already include a default **Page 1** with a **textbox** visual for the page title at position (20,20) with height 90 -- do NOT add a new textbox; rename the existing page with `pbir pages rename` instead. **Place all visuals at y:120 or below** to avoid overlapping the title textbox.

## Quick Reference

1. Get the workspace and semantic model from the user. If the user wants to connect to Power BI Desktop or create a report with source data, explain that a published semantic model in Fabric or Power BI is required first.
2. Analyze the user's requirements. Consider missing information -- charts, filters, formatting, analyses. Use `AskUserQuestion` if something is unclear.
3. Assemble a design brief (audience, purpose, decision questions, page list with per-page intent, committed design identity, delivery target); get user approval before building; see `references/design-brief.md`.
4. Consider missing semantic model objects -- not just what the user asks for, but targets (1 year prior), baselines (avg for period), or trend aggregations (14-day rolling) that enrich visuals.
5. Create a project folder and report (default format is PBIP):

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /path/to/report-name
    cd /path/to/report-name
    pbir new report "Name.Report" -c "Workspace/Model.SemanticModel"
    ```

6. Rename the default page (do NOT add a new page unless the report needs multiple pages): `pbir pages rename "Name.Report/Page 1.Page" --to "Overview" -f`
7. Only if the user requests a custom theme: `pbir theme apply-template "Name.Report" template-name` (the sqlbi theme is already included by default)
8. Discover model fields: `pbir model "Name.Report" -d`
9. Query field values for filters or formatting: `pbir model "Name.Report" -q "EVALUATE VALUES('Table'[Column])"`
10. Inspect field data types: `pbir model "Name.Report" -d -t Table`
11. Add visuals (the page already has a textbox for the title): `pbir add visual kpi "Name.Report/Overview.Page" --title "Revenue"`
12. Configure query reduction (slicers + heavy visuals): see `references/interactivity.md`
13. Wire cross-filter overrides and page navigation: see `references/interactivity.md`
14. Add filters and slicers; configure slicer sync and reset: see `references/interactivity.md`
15. Validate: `pbir validate "Name.Report"`
16. Publish: `pbir publish "Name.Report" "Workspace.Workspace/Name.Report"`
17. Open in Fabric after publish: `pbir publish "Name.Report" "Workspace.Workspace/Name.Report" -o`
18. Or open locally in Power BI Desktop: `pbir open "Name.Report"`

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Understand the Business Process

Before creating visuals, explore the semantic model to understand the domain. Use `pbir model "Report.Report" -d` to inspect tables, columns, measures, and hierarchies. Consider:

- What domain does this model cover? (sales, finance, operations, logistics, etc.)
- What KPIs and measures matter most?
- What dimensions and hierarchies exist for slicing data?
- What time granularity makes sense? (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)

Present a concrete proposal via `AskUserQuestion` before building anything. The proposal should include:

- Which KPI cards to show and what measures they display
- What trend chart(s) to include and at what time granularity
- Which categorical breakdowns are most insightful
- What detail table/matrix to provide and with what hierarchies
- How filters should scope the data

Iterate on the design before executing -- revising a plan is cheaper than rebuilding visuals.

### Step 1b: Assemble and Lock the Design Brief

Consolidate the Step 1 exploration and any vague-prompt findings into one design brief. This is not a second round of requirements gathering; it freezes what is already known into a single spec the build steps execute against. The brief names the audience, the purpose, the 2-5 decision questions a viewer must answer, a page list where each page carries one stated intent, the committed design identity (tone plus signature), and the delivery target. See **`references/design-brief.md`** for the copy-able template and how to fill each field.

Present the brief once via `AskUserQuestion` for explicit "yes" or "change X" approval. On approval, treat it as frozen: the build steps run against it without re-litigating scope, and any later scope change re-opens the brief rather than silently drifting the visuals.

The approved brief routes to the **`pbi-report-design`** skill (which owns the design canon: commit the identity there, and map each page intent to a concrete layout), then into the build steps below. Reference identity and page-intent-to-layout by concept; `pbi-report-design` is the home for that reasoning, so do not restate it here.

### Step 2: Identify Location and Connection

Determine where to create the report and which model it connects to. Purpose, audience, and decision questions are already settled in the locked brief (Step 1b); do not re-elicit them here.

```bash
pbir model                                       # List all known reports/models
pbir connect MyWorkspace MyReport                # Set active connection
```

If the user provides a workspace location, create the report locally in a project folder, then publish.

### Step 3: Create the Report

Create a project folder first, then the report inside it. Default format is PBIP.

```bash
mkdir -p sales-dashboard && cd sales-dashboard
pbir new report "Sales.Report" -c "MyWorkspace/Sales.SemanticModel"
```

The resulting structure:

```
sales-dashboard/
  Sales.Report/
    definition/
      pages/
      report.json
    StaticResources/
    definition.pbir
  Sales.pbip
```

### Step 4: Rename Default Page and Add More Pages

The report comes with a default "Page 1" that already has a textbox for the page title. Rename it rather than creating a new page. Only add additional pages if needed.

```bash
pbir pages rename "Sales.Report/Page 1.Page" --to "Overview" -f  # Rename default page
pbir add page "Sales.Report/Detail.Page" -n "Detail"              # Add extra pages only if needed
pbir pages active-page "Sales.Report" "Overview"
```

### Step 5: Configure Theme (only if user requests)

The sqlbi theme is already included by default. Only modify the theme if the user explicitly asks for a different theme or custom colors.

```bash
# Only if user wants a different theme:
pbir theme apply-template "Sales.Report" custom-theme

# Or to customize specific colors:
pbir theme set-colors "Sales.Report" --good "#00B050" --bad "#FF0000"
pbir theme set-text-classes "Sales.Report" title --font-size 16
pbir theme set-formatting "Sales.Report" "card.*.border.radius" --value 8
```

### Step 6: Add Visuals to Pages

Check actual page dimensions first -- do not assume 1280x720. Use `pbir pages json "Report.Report/Page.Page"` to verify. The object model validates that visuals fit within page bounds.

Fill the canvas with a purposeful visual hierarchy. Standard composition for a 1280x720 page:

- **Row 1 (y: 20-160): KPI visuals** -- 2-3 `kpi` visuals showing headline metrics with targets and trend lines
- **Row 2 (y: 180-460): Trend + Breakdown** -- Line/area chart (~60% width) + bar/column chart (~40% width)
- **Row 3 (y: 480-700): Detail table/matrix** -- Full-width `tableEx` or `matrix` with hierarchies and conditional formatting

For a complete layout example with exact coordinates, spacing verification, and visual commands, consult **`references/layout-example.md`**.

Key principles:

- **Consistent spacing**: Calculate positions from `(margin, gap, page_width, page_height)`. For 1280x720 with margin=24, gap=16, usable width = 1232. Verify arithmetic before placing visuals.
- **No redundant titles**: Page title = subject ("Order Lines"), visual titles = differentiator ("by Key Account", "Monthly Trend"). Hide subtitles: `pbir visuals subtitle "path" --no-show`
- **Sorting**: Charts auto-sort descending by first measure. After `pbir visuals bind`, set sort explicitly: `pbir visuals sort "path" -f "Table.Measure" -d Descending`

For reports where users pick which measure or dimension to view, use field parameters to collapse N near-duplicate visuals into one. See **`references/interactivity.md`** (Field Parameters section).

### Step 7: Configure Query Reduction

For any report with slicers or a busy page (matrices, maps, high-cardinality tables), apply query reduction at creation -- not after. Retrofitting leaves stale interaction pairs and the page may already have unintended cross-filtering wired in.

The three components (see **`references/interactivity.md`** for full detail):

1. Add `NoFilter` `visualInteractions` pairs from each slicer to heavy visuals
2. Enable the filter-pane Apply button: `pbir filters pane-set`
3. Enable per-slicer Apply buttons: `pbir visuals format` on each slicer

For Import-mode reports with cheap queries, evaluate whether disabling cross-highlight is worth the loss of interactivity before applying.

### Step 8: Wire Interactions and Navigation

After placing visuals, set cross-filter overrides and build navigation. Default is everything cross-filters everything, so author only the exceptions. For multi-page reports, add a `pageNavigator` visual rather than individual buttons.

See **`references/interactivity.md`** (Wiring Interactions and Navigation section) for the step-by-step and pitfalls.

### Step 9: Add Filters and Slicers

```bash
pbir add filter Date Year -r "Sales.Report" --values 2025
pbir add filter Geography Region -r "Sales.Report"
pbir add filter Products Category -p "Sales.Report/Detail.Page"
```

For slicer type selection, sync groups, and reset/persist filter patterns, see **`references/interactivity.md`** (Slicer Type, Sync, and Reset section).

### Step 10: Format Visuals

Most formatting should come from the theme (Step 5). Apply bespoke formatting only for genuinely one-off cases.

```bash
# Bulk formatting via glob (requires -f for glob patterns)
pbir set "Sales.Report/**/*.Visual.title.show" --value true -f
pbir set "Sales.Report/**/*.Visual.border.show" --value true -f

# Individual visual formatting
pbir visuals title "Sales.Report/Overview.Page/Revenue.Visual" --fontSize 14 --bold
pbir visuals background "Sales.Report/Overview.Page/Revenue.Visual" --color "#F8F9FA"
```

For titles that react to slicer selections or change color with status, use a `_Report` extension measure:

```bash
# Author a selection-aware title measure
pbir dax measures add \
  "Sales.Report" \
  -n "Title_Sales" \
  -e 'IF(ISFILTERED(Region[Region]), "Sales: " & SELECTEDVALUE(Region[Region], "multiple regions"), "Sales: all regions")' \
  -t _Report

# Bind via title CF, or drive a textbox text run with the measure
```

Key rules for dynamic titles:
- `SELECTEDVALUE(..., "<fallback>")` is mandatory; without it the title disappears under multi-select
- Keep the text measure and color measure separate (one returns the string, one returns a theme token like "good"/"bad"); each is independently testable
- A measure-driven title and a literal title cannot coexist; clear the literal first
- Test across no/single/multi selection by reasoning about `ISFILTERED`/`HASONEVALUE`, then confirm via render

### Step 11: Validate

```bash
pbir validate "Sales.Report"
pbir tree "Sales.Report" -v
```

### Step 12: Publish or Open

```bash
pbir publish "Sales.Report" "MyWorkspace.Workspace/Sales.Report"      # Publish
pbir publish "Sales.Report" "MyWorkspace.Workspace/Sales.Report" -o   # Publish and open in browser
pbir open "Sales.Report"                                               # Open in Power BI Desktop
```

## Common Report Patterns

### Executive Dashboard

- 2-3 KPI cards at top (revenue, orders, margin)
- 1 trend line/area chart (monthly if yearly filter, daily/weekly if monthly)
- 1-2 breakdown charts (bar/column) by key categories
- 1 detail table or matrix with hierarchies and conditional formatting
- Page size: 1280x720 (16:9)

### Detailed Analysis

- Slicer bar at top (date range, category filters)
- Large table or matrix as main content with conditional formatting
- Supporting KPI cards for context
- Page size: 1280x720 or 1920x1080

### Tooltip Pages

- Small page (320x240 or similar)
- 2-3 focused visuals
- Set via `pbir pages type "path" --type tooltip`
