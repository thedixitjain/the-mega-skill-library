> **Platform Note:** State files use the platform's native directory: `.claude/` (Claude Code), `.codex/` (Codex CLI), or `.cursor/` (Cursor IDE). Shared metrics live in `.orchestrator/metrics/` (v2) with fallback to `<state-dir>/metrics/` for pre-v2.0 legacy data. See `skills/_shared/platform-tools.md`.

# Evolve Skill

## Phase 0: Bootstrap Gate

Read `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` and execute the gate check. If the gate is CLOSED, invoke `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` and wait for completion before proceeding. If the gate is OPEN, continue to Phase 1.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed past Phase 0 if GATE_CLOSED. There is no bypass. Refer to `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` for the full HARD-GATE constraints.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase 1: Config & Data Loading

### 1.1 Read Session Config

Read and parse Session Config per `skills/_shared/config-reading.md`. Store result as `$CONFIG`.

### 1.2 Check Persistence

Extract `persistence` from `$CONFIG`. If `persistence` is `false`, abort with message:

> "Learnings require persistence to be enabled in Session Config. Add `persistence: true` to your Session Config block (CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, AGENTS.md for Codex CLI)."

### 1.3 Determine Mode

Read mode from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If empty or not provided, default to `analyze`
- Valid modes: `analyze`, `review`, `list`, `dialectic`
- If invalid mode provided, report error and list valid modes

### 1.4 Load Data

**Lazy-create defensive (#185):** If `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` does not exist (pre-#185 repo or bootstrap skipped), create an empty file and emit an info log — do NOT hard-fail:

```bash
LEARNINGS_FILE=".orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl"
if [[ ! -f "$LEARNINGS_FILE" ]]; then
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LEARNINGS_FILE")"
  : > "$LEARNINGS_FILE"
  echo "info(#185): auto-created $LEARNINGS_FILE (was missing)" >&2
fi
```

This defensive step is idempotent and cheap — it ensures `/evolve analyze|review|list` never fails because of a missing artifact file.

1. Read `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` (session history). If it does not exist, check `<state-dir>/metrics/sessions.jsonl` as a legacy fallback (where `<state-dir>` is `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `.cursor/` per platform). If neither exists, warn: "No session history found. Run at least one session first."
2. Read `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` if it exists. If not found, check `<state-dir>/metrics/learnings.jsonl` as a legacy fallback.
3. Count existing learnings, note any where `expires_at` < current date (expired)

## Phase 2: Mode Dispatch

Route based on mode:
- `analyze` → Phase 3
- `review` → Phase 4
- `list` → Phase 5
- `dialectic` → Phase 6

---

## Phase 3: Analyze Mode (default)

Extract learnings from session history.

> **Vault Integration:** If `vault-integration.enabled` is `true` in Session Config, confirmed learnings are mirrored to the configured Obsidian vault after the atomic write (Step 3.5, step 9). See `docs/session-config-reference.md` for the `vault-integration` config block.

### Step 3.1: Read Session Data

- Read all entries from `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` (or `<state-dir>/metrics/sessions.jsonl` if the v2 path does not exist — see Phase 1.4 fallback)
- Parse each JSONL line as JSON
- Sort by `completed_at` descending (most recent first)
- If no sessions found, abort: "No session data available. Complete at least one session before running evolve."

### Step 3.1b: Read Extra Sources (#638)

When `evolve.extra-sources` is configured in Session Config (default `[]` ⇒ this step is a no-op), `/evolve` consumes OUT-OF-BAND domain measurement sidecars to surface `domain-regression` learnings.

**READ-ONLY contract:** `/evolve` NEVER runs the domain measurement. The measurement (e.g. an eval-learn regression harness) runs elsewhere and writes a sidecar JSON; this step only READS that sidecar's output. Never shell out to produce the sidecar from here.

For each configured `extra-sources` entry `{path, kind, learning-type}`:

1. **Read the sidecar** at `path` (parser-validated as repo-relative, with absolute paths and `..` escape segments dropped before this step, then resolved against the repo root). If the file is missing or unreadable, **skip with a WARN** (`evolve: extra-source not found: <path>`) — do not abort the whole run.
2. **Schema-gate** the sidecar against the `kind`'s expected shape. For `kind: regression-flags` the schema is `{ flags: [ { metric, baseline, recent, delta } ] }`. If the parsed JSON does not match (missing `flags` array, or a flag missing a required field), **skip with a WARN** (`evolve: extra-source <path> failed regression-flags schema gate`) — never guess at a different shape.
3. **Emit one `domain-regression` learning candidate per flag that is PERSISTENT** — i.e. the same `metric` regressed across ≥2 consecutive sessions (cross-reference prior sessions' sidecar reads or the existing learnings store for the same `subject`). A one-off flag is noise; only a persistent regression earns a candidate.
   - `type`: `learning-type` from the entry (registered enum value `domain-regression`)
   - `subject`: the flag's `metric`
   - `insight`: a human-readable regression statement (e.g. "metric `<metric>` regressed: baseline <baseline> → recent <recent> (delta <delta>) persisting across ≥2 sessions")
   - `evidence`: `baseline → recent` (the concrete data points from the sidecar)
   - `confidence` / `expires_at`: derived via the existing confidence + decay infrastructure (Step 3.5), exactly as for the built-in learning types. `domain-regression` carries a 60-day TTL (`LEARNING_TTL_DAYS`).
4. Candidates flow into the SAME Step 3.4 AskUserQuestion confirmation + Step 3.5 write path as the built-in learning types — there is no separate write path.

### Step 3.2: Pattern Extraction

For each of the 9 built-in analyzer learning types, apply these heuristics:

#### 1. fragile-file (type: `fragile-file`)

- Look at wave data: if the same file appears in 3+ waves' `files_changed` within a session, it is fragile
- Cross-session: if a file appears in 3+ different sessions' `files_changed`, flag it
- Subject = file path (relative to project root)

#### 2. effective-sizing (type: `effective-sizing`)

- Compare `total_agents` and `total_waves` across session types
- Calculate average agents per wave for each session type
- Subject = canonical identifier like `deep-session-sizing` or `feature-session-sizing`
- Insight = "Deep sessions average X agents across Y waves" or "Feature sessions work well with X agents/wave"
- **Over-delivery ratio aggregation (#730/H4, #794.7):** compute the MEDIAN of `waves[].over_delivery_ratio` across the last ~5 `sessions.jsonl` records of the same `session_type`, filtered to waves whose `role` is not `Discovery`/`Finalization` and which carry the field (skip records lacking the field — pre-#730; also skip Discovery/Finalization waves, whose planned set is empty by design). This exclusion clause is intentionally identical to `skills/session-plan/SKILL.md` Step 0.5 "Over-delivery sizing" — keep the two wordings in sync on edit. Fold the median into this candidate's `insight`/`evidence` fields — e.g. `evidence`: `"median_over_delivery_ratio: 1.4 (n=12 waves, session_type=deep)"` — so `session-plan` Step 0.5 can read the ratio from the `effective-sizing` learning first, falling back to its own direct `sessions.jsonl` scan only when no such learning exists.

#### 3. recurring-issue (type: `recurring-issue`)

- Look at `agent_summary` — if `failed` or `partial` > 0 across multiple sessions, flag
- Check wave `quality` fields — repeated failures indicate recurring issues
- Subject = issue pattern identifier (e.g., "test-failures-in-wave-execution", "lint-regressions")

#### 4. scope-guidance (type: `scope-guidance`)

- Cross-reference `effectiveness.planned_issues` vs `effectiveness.completion_rate`
- **Skip sessions that lack the `effectiveness` field** (early sessions may not have it)
- If completion_rate is consistently 1.0 with N issues, note "N issues per session works well"
- If completion_rate < 0.7, note "scope was too large"
- Subject = `optimal-scope-per-session-type`

#### 5. deviation-pattern (type: `deviation-pattern`)

> **Ownership Reference:** See `skills/_shared/state-ownership.md`. evolve has read-only access to STATE.md.

- Read `<state-dir>/STATE.md` if it exists and check `## Deviations` section
- Cross-reference with session duration vs planned waves
- Subject = pattern name (e.g., "scope-creep-in-feature-sessions", "underestimated-complexity")

#### 6. stagnation-class-frequency (type: `stagnation-class-frequency`)

- Read `stagnation_events` from the most recent 5 sessions in `sessions.jsonl` (skip sessions lacking the field — they predate #84).
- For each `(file, error_class)` pair appearing in ≥2 sessions, extract a candidate:
  - Subject = `<file>:<error_class>` (e.g., `skills/wave-executor/wave-loop.md:edit-format-friction`)
  - Insight = "File <X> has <error_class> stagnation in <N> recent sessions — candidate for pre-edit grounding (#85)."
  - Evidence = "<N> sessions with stagnation_events for this file/class"
- These learnings feed #85 (pre-edit grounding injection) when it ships — high-frequency pairs trigger grounding.

#### 7. hardware-pattern (type: `hardware-pattern`)

> **v3.1.0 / Sub-Epic #160 (C2, issue #171).** Keyed on `host_class` rather than project — surfaces hardware-bound problems that affect the user across every repo on the same machine. Complements the project-keyed types above.

- Read `.orchestrator/metrics/events.jsonl` (session + wave events) and the registry `sweep.log` at `~/.config/session-orchestrator/sessions/sweep.log`. Both are optional — missing files produce no candidates.
- Invoke `scripts/lib/hardware-pattern-detector.mjs` → `detectHardwarePatterns({events, sweepLogEntries, thresholds})`. Thresholds come from Session Config `resource-thresholds` when present, falling back to `DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS`.
- Five detection signals (aggregated per `(signal, host_class)` pair, ≥2 occurrences required):
  - **oom-kill** — `orchestrator.session.stopped` with `exit_code: 137` or OOM-marker in `error`
  - **heartbeat-gap** — registry sweep-log entries with `gap_minutes` above `resource-thresholds.zombie-threshold-min`
  - **concurrent-session-pressure** — session-start events with `peer_count ≥ concurrent-sessions-warn`
  - **disk-full** — events whose `error` matches `ENOSPC` / "no space left"
  - **thermal-throttle** — events whose `resource_snapshot.cpu_load_pct` crosses `cpu-load-max-pct`
- Each candidate is piped through `candidateToLearning()` → `validateLearning()`. Default `scope` is `private` (in-repo only). To promote to `public`, the user runs `npm run share:hw-learnings -- --promote` (C3 export). This anonymizes each `private` hardware-pattern entry, validates via the privacy contract, and appends a `public` twin to `learnings.jsonl` (original preserved). Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing.
- Subject convention: `<signal>::<host_class>` (e.g., `oom-kill::macos-arm64-m3pro`). The `::` separator avoids colliding with project-keyed subjects.
- Confidence starts at 0.5 like other learning types, but decay is slower in practice: hardware stays the same longer than code. This is an emergent property of the existing expire-after-N-days policy applied to a mostly-stable `host_class` — no special-casing needed.
- **Presentation in step 3.5** (see below): render hardware-patterns in a dedicated section titled `## Hardware Patterns (keyed on host_class)` after the project-keyed patterns. This makes the source of the learning obvious to the user at confirmation time.

#### 8. autopilot-effectiveness (type: `autopilot-effectiveness`)

> **v3.2 Autopilot / Sub-Epic #271 (issue #298).** Compares manual vs. autopilot session outcomes per mode (housekeeping, feature, deep) so the loop can learn whether walk-away runs preserve quality. Complements the project-keyed and hardware-keyed types above.

- Read `.orchestrator/metrics/autopilot.jsonl` (one record per autopilot loop run) **and** `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` (manual + autopilot session outcomes). Both are optional — missing files produce no candidates.
- Invoke `scripts/lib/evolve/autopilot-effectiveness.mjs` → `analyze(autopilotRuns, sessions)`. The module pairs records by `mode` and compares completion-rate, carryover-rate, kill-switch frequency, and quality-gate pass-rate between the two populations.
- **Data-gating contract:** the analyzer requires **≥20 paired manual+autopilot runs per mode** before emitting any candidates. Below that threshold the function returns `[]` (empty input contract) — evolve simply skips this type for that mode and reports nothing. This prevents premature conclusions from small samples (#297 calibration depends on the same threshold).
- Subject convention: `<mode>-manual-vs-autopilot` (e.g., `housekeeping-manual-vs-autopilot`, `feature-manual-vs-autopilot`, `deep-manual-vs-autopilot`). One subject per mode that crosses threshold.
- Insight = "Autopilot <mode> sessions complete at <X>% vs. manual <Y>% (Δ <Z>pp across N pairs)" or analogous carryover/kill-switch framing when those signals dominate.
- Confidence starts at 0.5 like other learning types; lifecycle ±0.15 / -0.20 via the existing dedupe-and-update infrastructure in Step 3.3 — no special-casing.
- Each candidate is piped through `candidateToLearning()` → `validateLearning()` exactly like the other types. Default `scope` is `private` (autopilot RUN data is per-host until the user opts in to share). (refs #298)

#### 9. autonomy-verdict (type: `autonomy-verdict`)

> **Dispatcher Autonomy / P3.5 (issue #683).** Synthesizes per-repo or per-scope autonomy readiness from autopilot run outcomes plus advisory skill-judge signals. Complements `autopilot-effectiveness`: type 8 asks whether autopilot preserves quality by mode; this type asks whether a repo/scope is ready for more dispatcher autonomy.

- Read `.orchestrator/metrics/autopilot.jsonl`, `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl`, and `.orchestrator/metrics/skill-judgments.jsonl`. All are optional — missing files produce no candidates.
- Invoke `scripts/lib/evolve/autonomy-verdict.mjs` → `analyze(autopilotRuns, sessions, skillJudgments, { repo | scope })`. The analyzer reuses the type-8 mode rollups and combines them with counted skill-judge `applied`/`completed` signals.
- **Data-gating contract:** the analyzer requires **≥1 autopilot run and ≥1 canonical advisory skill-judge judgment** (`schema_version: 1`, `event: "judged"`, `advisory: true`) before emitting a candidate. Below that threshold it returns `[]` so `/evolve analyze` stays quiet during cold-start.
- Subject convention: `<repo-or-scope>-autonomy-readiness` (e.g., `session-orchestrator-autonomy-readiness`).
- Insight frames the readiness verdict (`ready`, `watch`, or `not-ready`), the combined score, and the signal counts. Evidence includes the normalized scope, verdict, autopilot summary, and skill-judge summary.
- Confidence is derived in the analyzer from signal volume, judge confidence, and score separation, then flows through the existing dedupe-and-update infrastructure in Step 3.3. Default `scope` is `private` because autopilot and skill-judge data are host/session-local. (refs #683)

### Step 3.2b: Zero Patterns Check

If no patterns were extracted across all built-in analyzers and configured extra sources, report: "No patterns found in session history. This can happen with very few sessions or sessions that lack detailed wave/agent data." and skip to end (do not proceed to AskUserQuestion).

### Step 3.3: Deduplicate Against Existing Learnings

For each extracted pattern, check if a learning with same `type` + `subject` already exists in `learnings.jsonl`:

- **If exists:** propose confidence update (+0.15 if confirmed by new evidence, -0.2 if contradicted)
- **If new:** propose as new learning with confidence 0.5

### Step 3.4: Present Findings via AskUserQuestion

Present extracted patterns to the user for confirmation. Use AskUserQuestion with `multiSelect: true`:

> On Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as a numbered Markdown list.

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Which learnings should be saved?\n\nExtracted patterns from session history:",
    header: "Evolve — Confirm Learnings",
    options: [
      {
        label: "[type] subject",
        description: "insight | evidence: ... | confidence: 0.5 (new) or +0.15 (update)"
      },
      ...
      {
        label: "Skip all",
        description: "Do not save any learnings this time"
      }
    ],
    multiSelect: true
  }]
})
```

If user selects "Skip all" or selects nothing, abort gracefully: "No learnings saved."

### Step 3.5: Write Confirmed Learnings

For confirmed learnings, use atomic rewrite strategy:

1. Read ALL existing lines from `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` (if exists) into memory. If not found, check `<state-dir>/metrics/learnings.jsonl` as a legacy fallback. If legacy data is found, it will be migrated to the v2 path on write (step 8).
2. Apply confidence updates for confirmed existing learnings:
   - Increment confidence by +0.15
   - Cap at 1.0
   - Reset `expires_at` using `deriveExpiresAt(now, type)` unless the candidate supplies a more specific expiry
3. Apply confidence decrements for contradicted learnings (-0.2) — do NOT reset `expires_at` for contradicted learnings (let them decay naturally)
4. Append new learnings with the **canonical schema_version:1 shape** — every field is required (#303):
   - `schema_version`: **1** (integer, ALWAYS — never omit)
   - `id`: UUID v4 string generated via `node -e "const {randomUUID}=require('crypto');process.stdout.write(randomUUID())"` or `uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`. MUST be a non-empty UUID string. **Never omit** — missing `id` causes 100% mirror-skip (#303).
   - `type`: one of `fragile-file`, `effective-sizing`, `recurring-issue`, `scope-guidance`, `deviation-pattern`, `stagnation-class-frequency`, `hardware-pattern`, `autopilot-effectiveness`, `autonomy-verdict`, `domain-regression` (#638 — only when sourced from `evolve.extra-sources`, see Step 3.1b)
   - `subject`: the pattern subject
   - `insight`: human-readable description of the pattern. **MUST be `insight`** — do NOT use `description` or `recommendation` (legacy alias keys that vault-mirror cannot read; see #303).
   - `evidence`: specific data points that support the pattern
   - `confidence`: use the candidate's derived confidence when supplied (e.g., `autonomy-verdict`); otherwise 0.5 for new learnings
   - `source_session`: **non-empty kebab-slug string** identifying the session from which the pattern was extracted (e.g. `main-2026-04-27-1942`). MUST be a string — never an object, array, number, or null. If multiple sessions contributed, use the earliest. If unknown, use `"unknown"` (the string). **Never** pass `String(<object>)` — that yields `"[object Object]"` and breaks the YAML mirror downstream (#307). Optional pre-write validation: `jq -e 'select(.source_session | type == "string" and length > 2)'`.
   - `created_at`: current ISO 8601 date
   - `expires_at`: preserve the candidate's derived expiry when supplied; otherwise derive from `LEARNING_TTL_DAYS[type]` via `deriveExpiresAt()` (falling back to the schema default) rather than hard-coding a 30-day horizon
5. **Verify write**: Read back the first line of the written file to confirm valid JSON. If read-back fails or is not valid JSON, report error to user.
6. **Prune:** remove entries where `expires_at` < current date OR `confidence` <= 0.0
7. **Consolidate duplicates (NULL-SUBJECT SAFE):** if same `type` + `subject` appears more than once
   AND `subject` is a non-empty string, keep the entry with highest confidence.
   Entries with null/empty/missing `subject` are NEVER collapsed — each is keyed by its unique `id`
   and always preserved. (Fix for issue #284: empty-subject dedupe collapse.)
8. Write entire result back to `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` with `>` (atomic rewrite, NOT append `>>`)
9. **Vault mirror (conditional):** Check `$CONFIG."vault-integration".enabled` via jq. If the field is missing or `false`, skip this step entirely — skill behavior is unchanged.

   If `enabled` is `true`:

   a. Check `$CONFIG."vault-integration".mode`. If `mode` is `off`, skip the mirror invocation (treat as disabled). If `mode` is absent, default to `warn`.

   b. Resolve the vault directory: use `$CONFIG."vault-integration"."vault-dir"` if non-null, otherwise fall back to the `$VAULT_DIR` environment variable. If neither is set, emit a warning and skip.

   c. Invoke the mirror script. Derive a synthetic `EVOLVE_SESSION_ID` so the vault-mirror auto-commit phase (#31) produces a traceable commit subject (`chore(vault): mirror evolve-<date> — N learnings + 0 sessions`). Pass `--vault-name` when `vault-integration.vault-name` is set in Session Config:
      ```bash
      EVOLVE_SESSION_ID="evolve-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)"
      EVOLVE_VAULT_NAME=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq -r '."vault-integration"."vault-name" // empty')
      node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/vault-mirror.mjs" \
        --vault-dir "<vault-dir>" \
        --source .orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl \
        --kind learning \
        --session-id "$EVOLVE_SESSION_ID" \
        ${EVOLVE_VAULT_NAME:+--vault-name "$EVOLVE_VAULT_NAME"}
      ```

   d. Handle the exit code according to `mode`:
      - `warn` (default): on non-zero exit, surface a warning in evolve output (e.g. "Warning: vault mirror failed — learnings saved locally but not mirrored.") but do NOT fail the skill.
      - `strict`: on non-zero exit, fail the skill immediately and report the error to the user.

   e. On success (exit 0), report: "Mirrored N learnings to `<vault-dir>/40-learnings/`."

Report: "Saved N new learnings, updated M existing. Total active: K."

### Step 3.6: C2 Auto-Repair Feeder (opt-in — #647)

> **Default OFF (advisory-only).** With no `skill-evolution:` block in Session Config, this step surfaces repair candidates as ADVICE only — it applies nothing and opens no MR. This mirrors the opt-in precedent of `slopcheck` (#520) and `verification-auto-fix` (#521): the engine is dark unless explicitly enabled.

After confirmed learnings are written (Step 3.5), the actionable subset can feed the C2 tiered auto-repair engine (Epic #643 / issue #647). This is a pointer section — the modules own the logic; do not duplicate it here.

**`skill-evolution:` is a DISTINCT sibling of the pre-existing `evolve:` block.** `evolve:` (`extra-sources`) tunes learning EXTRACTION (Step 3.1b); `skill-evolution:` tunes repair AUTONOMY. They are parsed by different modules and never share keys — do not conflate them. The `skill-evolution:` block is parsed by `scripts/lib/config/skill-evolution.mjs` (`_parseSkillEvolution`) and surfaced at `$CONFIG['skill-evolution']` (wired in `scripts/lib/config.mjs`). Shape: `{ autonomy: 'off'|'advisory'|'autonomous-gated', 'evidence-floor': number, judge: boolean }`, default `autonomy: 'off'`. Do NOT add `skill-evolution:` as a column-0 key to any consolidated Session Config parity block — it is a standalone top-level block (claude-md-drift-check Check-6 enforces parity only on the `## Session Config` keys).

**Candidate intake.** Pass the post-Step-3.5 learnings (and, when available, the `claude-md-drift-check` result) to `extractCandidates({ learnings, driftResult, evidenceFloor: $CONFIG['skill-evolution']['evidence-floor'], now })` from `scripts/lib/skill-evolution/candidate-intake.mjs`. It is a pure transform — only actionable, non-expired learnings whose `confidence ≥ evidence-floor` AND whose insight is prescriptive AND resolves to a repo-relative path become `RepairCandidate`s.

**Gate per artifact type.** Each candidate's `target_path` is classified by `classifyTarget(target_path, { repoRoot })` from `scripts/lib/skill-evolution/blast-radius-classifier.mjs` (the heart of the design; path-traversal-safe, fail-closed):

| Target type | Gate | Posture |
|---|---|---|
| plugin-skill (`skills/…`) | none | **always-mr** — never autonomous |
| local-skill (`.claude/skills/…`) | none | **always-mr** — never autonomous |
| local-config (ROOT `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` Session Config) | config-validation | **autonomous-gated** |
| anything else | none | always-mr (fail-closed) |

Only ROOT-instruction Session Config edits are eligible for autonomous apply, and only when ALL of: `runConfigValidationGate({ repoRoot })` (`scripts/lib/skill-evolution/config-validation-gate.mjs`) is GREEN (parse-config + config-schema + claude-md-drift-check) **AND** `evidence ≥ evidence-floor` **AND** `autonomy: autonomous-gated`. Skill repairs are MR-only by construction.

**Invocation contract (this foundation slice = ADVISORY surfacing).** The single orchestrator that ties intake → classify → gate → route → stamp together is `runRepairEngine({ repoRoot, config, learnings, driftResult, dryRun })` from `scripts/lib/skill-evolution/engine.mjs` — it returns `{ outcomes, summary }` and applies the full gate-per-artifact-type decision matrix internally (`autonomy: off` ⇒ every outcome is advisory-only). In the default/advisory posture, `/evolve` SURFACES candidates and their classification only — it does not apply or open MRs. Apply is gated on the config-validation gate above; MR-opening (`openRepairMr({ candidate, diff, repoRoot, dryRun })` from `scripts/lib/skill-evolution/mr-opener.mjs`) is gated on `autonomy != off`. Candidate de-dup / `processed_at` lifecycle is owned by `scripts/lib/skill-evolution/idempotency.mjs`. When `autonomy: off` (default), report the surfaced candidates as advice and stop.

---

## Phase 4: Review Mode

Interactive management of existing learnings.

### Step 4.1: Load Learnings

- Read `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl`. If not found, check `<state-dir>/metrics/learnings.jsonl` as a legacy fallback.
- If neither exists or both are empty: "No learnings found. Run `/evolve analyze` first."
- Parse each line as JSON

### Step 4.2: Display Learnings

Present a formatted table grouped by type. Include the **Effective** column — the
recency-decayed surfacing score (#670) — so stale high-confidence entries are visible
as decay candidates next to their static confidence:

```
## Active Learnings

| # | Type | Subject | Confidence | Effective | Expires | Insight |
|---|------|---------|------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | fragile-file | src/lib/auth.ts | 0.80 | 0.78 | 2026-07-05 | Changed in 4 of last 5 sessions |
| 2 | effective-sizing | feature-session-sizing | 0.65 | 0.61 | 2026-06-20 | Feature sessions work well with 3 agents/wave |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Summary: N active learnings (M high confidence, K expiring soon)
```

> **Effective (decayed) score — #670.** Retrieval/surfacing ranks by an
> `effectiveScore = max(confidence × 0.5^(ageDays / halfLifeDays), confidence × floorFactor)`
> blend, NOT raw confidence. `ageDays` derives from `last_reinforced` / `last_accessed` /
> `updated_at` when present, else `created_at`. So a stale high-confidence learning ranks
> below a fresh mid-confidence one, while the `floorFactor` (default 0.1) guarantees a
> durable learning never collapses to ~0. Tuned under the existing `evolve:` Session Config
> block (`decay-enabled: true`, `decay-half-life-days: 90`, `decay-floor-factor: 0.1` — all
> conservative defaults; set `decay-enabled: false` to restore pure-confidence ordering).
> Implemented in `scripts/lib/learnings/surface.mjs` (`effectiveScore` + `surfaceTopN`).
> The confidence FILTER (`> 0.3`) is unchanged — decay re-ranks survivors, it does not
> change eligibility.

### Step 4.3: Interactive Management

AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What would you like to do with your learnings?",

If user selects "Boost confidence", "Reduce confidence", "Delete specific learnings", or "Extend expiry", present a follow-up AskUserQuestion with `multiSelect: true` listing all learnings by `# | type | subject` so the user can select which ones to modify.

### Step 4.4: Apply Changes

Use the same atomic rewrite strategy as Phase 3, Step 3.5:

1. Read all lines from `learnings.jsonl`
2. Apply the selected operation to selected learnings:
   - **Boost:** +0.15 confidence (cap 1.0), reset expires_at to +`learning-expiry-days`
   - **Reduce:** -0.2 confidence
   - **Delete:** remove selected entries
   - **Extend:** reset expires_at to current date + `learning-expiry-days`
3. Prune entries where `expires_at` < current date OR `confidence` <= 0.0
4. Consolidate duplicates (same `type` + non-empty `subject`): keep highest confidence.
   Null-subject entries are preserved individually (keyed by `id`). See SKILL.md #284 fix note.
5. Write entire result back with `>` (atomic rewrite)

Report: "Updated N learnings. Total active: K."

## Phase 5: List Mode

Simple read-only display.

### Step 5.1: Load and Display

- Read `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl`. If not found, check `<state-dir>/metrics/learnings.jsonl` as a legacy fallback.
- If neither exists: "No learnings yet. Run `/evolve analyze` to extract patterns from session history."
- Parse each line as JSON

### Step 5.2: Formatted Output

Display a formatted table grouped by type:

```
## Active Learnings

### fragile-file
| Subject | Confidence | Expires | Insight |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### effective-sizing
| Subject | Confidence | Expires | Insight |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

(repeat for each type that has entries)
```

### Step 5.3: Summary

Display summary line:

```
N active learnings (M high confidence, K expiring soon)
```

- **High confidence** = confidence > 0.7
- **Expiring soon** = expires_at within 14 days of current date

---

## Phase 6: Dialectic Mode

Single-pass LLM derivation of USER.md + AGENT.md (peer cards from #503) updates from current learnings + sessions + steering files. Dry-run-default per #506 EARS contract.

### Step 6.0: Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for trailing flags after the `dialectic` keyword:

| Flag | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `--apply` | `false` | Write diff to USER.md/AGENT.md via merger.mjs; without it = dry-run |
| `--dry-run` | `true` | Explicit dry-run (default); mutually exclusive with --apply |
| `--model <name>` | from Session Config `dialectic.model` (default `haiku`) | Override LLM |
| `--budget-tokens <N>` | from Session Config `dialectic.budget-tokens` (default 8000) | Token budget |

Mutex check: `--apply` + `--dry-run` together = error "flags mutually exclusive".

### Step 6.1: Pre-checks
- Bootstrap gate (Phase 0) — already executed
- Persistence check (Phase 1.2) — already executed
- Cadence check: if invoked via session-end Phase 3.6.7 auto-trigger, the trigger has already pre-checked cadence. For manual invocation, skip cadence — manual always runs.

### Step 6.2: Data Load
Read all 4 input sources via `runDialecticDeriver()` from `scripts/dialectic-deriver.mjs` (see W2 I1):
1. Top-N learnings from `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` (default 50, sorted by confidence DESC)
2. Last-K sessions from `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` (default 10, sorted by completed_at DESC)
3. Peer cards via `readPeerCards(repoRoot)` from `scripts/lib/peer-cards/reader.mjs` — returns `{user, agent}` or null
4. Project steering files (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md Session Config block + narratives)

Graceful degradation: any null/empty source is acceptable. If ALL inputs empty → return `{status: 'empty-input'}`.

### Step 6.3: Dispatch the Deriver Agent

Construct a `dispatchAgent` function that uses the harness Agent tool to invoke the `dialectic-deriver` agent (see `agents/dialectic-deriver.md`):

```javascript
const dispatchAgent = async ({ model, prompt, maxTokens }) => {
  // Coordinator uses Agent tool with subagent_type: "session-orchestrator:dialectic-deriver"
  // and the model parameter to invoke the right tier
  const result = await Agent({
    description: "Dialectic-deriver LLM pass",
    subagent_type: "session-orchestrator:dialectic-deriver",
    model,
    prompt,
  });
  return { text: result.text, usage: result.usage ?? { input_tokens: 0, output_tokens: 0 } };
};

> **Why `maxTokens` is not passed to Agent():** the Claude Code harness `Agent()` tool does not currently accept a `max_tokens` parameter. Output-token budget is therefore enforced via prompt text (see line 414 in `skills/session-end/SKILL.md`: "with budget ${budget-tokens} input + 4000 output tokens"). The dispatchAgent contract declares `maxTokens` as the canonical interface; the evolve skill destructures it for forward-compat but routes enforcement through the prompt body. When the harness adds a max_tokens hint, this dispatchAgent becomes the single update point.

const result = await runDialecticDeriver({
  dispatchAgent,
  repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  model: argv.model ?? config.dialectic?.model ?? 'haiku',
  budget: { input: argv['budget-tokens'] ?? config.dialectic?.['budget-tokens'] ?? 8000, output: 4000 },
  dryRun: !argv.apply,
  allowEmptying: argv['allow-emptying'] ?? false,
});
```

### Step 6.4: Diff Output & Apply Gate
- If dry-run (default): present diff inline; write to `.orchestrator/dialectic-pending.md` (atomic tmp+rename); EXIT. Suggestion: "Re-run with `/evolve --dialectic --apply` to apply."
- If `--apply`: call `mergePeerCard(existingBody, managedUpdates)` from `scripts/lib/peer-cards/merger.mjs` for each card target, then `writePeerCard(repoRoot, 'user', mergedUserCard)` and `writePeerCard(repoRoot, 'agent', mergedAgentCard)` from `scripts/lib/peer-cards/writer.mjs`. Update the `updated:` frontmatter.
- Report: `Dialectic-derived: M deltas to USER.md, N deltas to AGENT.md. Dry-run | Applied. Tokens: in=<X> out=<Y>.`

### Step 6.5: Error Handling
- `status: 'unknown-model'` → fail with clear error (already thrown by validateModel)
- `status: 'budget-exceeded'` → emit `{status:'budget-exceeded', used:N, budget:M}`, do NOT truncate
- `status: 'would-empty-card'` → warn + require `--allow-emptying` flag
- `status: 'empty-input'` → exit clean with message "dialectic: skipped (no input)"
- subagent crash → log ⚠, exit cleanly (do NOT write to `.orchestrator/dialectic-pending.md`)

Cross-reference: PRD #506 AC1-AC4 + EARS gates. Vault Integration: dialectic does NOT mirror to vault (#506 scope — peer cards are repo-local by design; vault mirror is for cross-repo sessions/learnings).

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** modify `learnings.jsonl` without reading it first — race condition prevention
- **NEVER** skip the deduplication check — duplicates degrade the intelligence system
- **NEVER** write learnings without user confirmation — always present via AskUserQuestion first (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as a numbered Markdown list)
- **ALWAYS** use uuid-v4 for new learning IDs (generate via `uuidgen` or equivalent bash command)
- **ALWAYS** preserve a candidate-supplied `expires_at`; otherwise derive it from `LEARNING_TTL_DAYS[type]` via `deriveExpiresAt()` rather than hard-coding `learning-expiry-days`
- **ALWAYS** present findings to user before writing — no silent writes
- **ALWAYS** use atomic rewrite (read all, modify, write all with `>`) — never append with `>>`
- **ALWAYS** cap confidence at 1.0 — never exceed

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** write learnings without user confirmation — always present via AskUserQuestion first (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as a numbered Markdown list)
- **DO NOT** append to `learnings.jsonl` — always use atomic rewrite (read all, modify, write all)
- **DO NOT** create duplicate learnings — always check type + subject match first
- **DO NOT** set confidence above 1.0 or forget to cap it
- **DO NOT** fabricate patterns — only extract from actual session data with verifiable evidence
- **DO NOT** skip the pruning step — expired and zero-confidence entries must be removed on every write
