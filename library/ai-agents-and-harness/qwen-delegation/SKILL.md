# Qwen CLI Delegation

## Overview

This skill implements `conjure:delegation-core` for the Qwen CLI.
It provides Qwen-specific authentication, quota management,
and command construction.

For shared delegation patterns, see `Skill(conjure:delegation-core)`.

## When To Use

- After `Skill(conjure:delegation-core)` determines Qwen is suitable
- When you need Qwen's large context window (100K+ tokens)
- For batch processing, summarization, or multi-file analysis
- If the `qwen` CLI is installed and configured

## When NOT To Use

- Choosing which provider to delegate to (use `conjure:delegation-core`)
- Gemini was the selected provider (use `conjure:gemini-delegation`)

## Prerequisites

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install Qwen CLI
pip install qwen-cli

# Verify installation
qwen --version

# Check authentication
qwen auth status

# Login if needed
qwen auth login

# Or set API key
export QWEN_API_KEY="your-key"
```
**Verification:** Run `python --version` to verify Python environment.

## Quick Start

### Using Shared Delegation Executor
```bash
# Basic file analysis
python ~/conjure/tools/delegation_executor.py qwen "Analyze this code" --files src/main.py

# With specific model
python ~/conjure/tools/delegation_executor.py qwen "Summarize" --files src/**/*.py --model qwen-max

# With output format
python ~/conjure/tools/delegation_executor.py qwen "Extract functions" --files src/main.py --format json
```

### Direct CLI Usage
```bash
# Basic command
qwen -p "@path/to/file Analyze this code"

# Multiple files
qwen -p "@src/**/*.py Summarize these files"

# Specific model
qwen --model qwen-max -p "..."
```

### Save Output
```bash
qwen -p "..." > delegations/qwen/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md
```

## Smart Delegation

The shared delegation executor can auto-select the best service:
```bash
# Auto-select based on requirements
python ~/conjure/tools/delegation_executor.py auto "Analyze large codebase" \
  --files src/**/* --requirement large_context
```

## Qwen-Specific Details

For Qwen-specific models, CLI options, cost reference,
and troubleshooting, see `modules/qwen-specifics.md`.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] `qwen --version` and `qwen auth status` (or `QWEN_API_KEY` env var set) both exit 0
  before any task is delegated; missing installation or failed authentication is reported
  and stops execution.
- [ ] The delegated task output is saved to `delegations/qwen/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` (timestamp
  format matching the Quick Start example), and that file exists on disk after delegation.
- [ ] If `conjure:delegation-core` selected a different provider (Gemini or local), this skill
  is not invoked; Qwen delegation only runs when delegation-core explicitly routes to Qwen.
- [ ] Smart delegation via `delegation_executor.py auto` logs which provider was selected and
  why before executing the task, so the selection is auditable.
