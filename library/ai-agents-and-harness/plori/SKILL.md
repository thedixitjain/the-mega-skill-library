# Using plori from an agent

plori (https://plori.ai) gives you AI agents. Each agent runs on its own cloud computer with a
persistent disk, a shell, developer tools, and memory. You can create agents, send them
work, and read their replies programmatically.

## Connect

MCP (recommended for a hosted client): Streamable HTTP at `https://api.plori.ai/mcp`.

- OAuth 2.1: compliant MCP clients connect with no hand-copied key. An unauthenticated
  request returns 401 with the discovery chain (RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata at
  https://api.plori.ai/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource, then dynamic client
  registration and authorization code + PKCE). The account owner signs in once with an
  email one-time code.
- API key: the account owner provisions a key at https://plori.ai and you send
  `Authorization: Bearer plori_sk_...`.

CLI (recommended from a terminal): `npm i -g @plori/cli`, or run it without installing
via `npx -y @plori/cli`, gives you the `plori` command for the same operations from your
shell. Authenticate with `plori login` or by setting `PLORI_API_KEY`. Output is
human-readable on a terminal and a single JSON document when piped or with `--json`, so it
composes in scripts. Commands are listed under "CLI commands" below.

REST: the same operations at `https://api.plori.ai/v1` with the same bearer token.
Full authentication instructions: https://plori.ai/auth.md

## Tools

Account and agents: `list_agents`, `get_agent`, `create_agent`
(name, optional model), `set_agent_model`, `delete_agent`, `get_credits`,
`get_usage`, `get_disk`.

Runs: `invoke_agent` sends a message and by default blocks until the turn finishes,
returning the assistant's reply. Pass `wait=false` to get a `run_id` immediately and
poll `get_run_result`. `list_runs` lists recent runs.

Human in the loop: a run can pause on an approval or input request (status
`awaiting_input`). Read the queue with `list_pending_inputs` and reply with
`answer_pending_input` (run_id + tool_call_id, then approved=true/false for approvals
or value for input requests).

Deferred work: `schedule_run` (agent_id, prompt, and delay_seconds or an RFC3339
fire_at) invokes the agent later as an ordinary run.

Workflows: `list_workflows`, `create_workflow` (name, optional description/trigger_kind/
cron_expr), `run_workflow` (runs a workflow now: a real execution billed like any run,
returning the execution, terminal or still `running`), and `get_workflow_execution` to poll
one. A workflow's steps are built by an agent; these tools manage and run the result.

## CLI commands

The CLI mirrors the tools above; an agent is addressable by name or id, and every command
accepts `--json`.

- `plori create <name>`: get or create an agent by name (reusing a name returns the
  existing agent). `plori agents`, `plori agent <name>`, `plori set-model <name> <model>`,
  `plori delete <name> --yes`.
- `plori run <name> "message"`: send a message and, by default, wait for the reply and
  print it. Add `--follow` to stream the turn live, or `--no-wait` to get a run id back
  immediately. Pass `-` as the message to read it from stdin.
- `plori result <name> <run-id>` (add `--wait` to block) and `plori runs <name>` read
  run status and history.
- `plori inputs <name>` lists runs paused on a human request; `plori answer <run-id>
  <tool-call-id> --approve|--deny|--value <v>` replies.
- `plori schedule <name> "prompt" --in <seconds>` (or `--at <rfc3339>`) defers a run;
  `plori schedules <name>` and `plori unschedule <name> <id>` manage them.
- `plori workflows list`, `plori workflows create <name> [--trigger cron --cron <expr>]`,
  `plori workflows run <name|id>` (run it now), `plori workflows execution <name|id> <exec-id>`.
- `plori credits`, `plori usage`, `plori disk` read account state.

## Costs and limits

Running an agent spends credits; check `get_credits` before invoking. Agent count and
model tier follow the account's plan. Every call is scoped to the account that owns the
credential; there is no cross-account access.
