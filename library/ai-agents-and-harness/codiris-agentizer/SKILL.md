# Codiris Agentizer v2 — Intelligent Website-to-Agentfront

Transform any website into a custom AI-powered agentfront. The skill deeply analyzes the company — its market, products, value proposition, customers — then builds a tailored experience. NOT a template copy-paste.

## Core Principle

**Understand the company first, build second.** Every company is different:
- Stripe sells APIs to developers → show API products, code examples, pricing tiers
- Nike sells shoes to consumers → show product catalog, categories, shopping
- Visa sells payment cards → show card tiers, comparisons, benefits
- Salesforce sells enterprise SaaS → show solutions by industry, case studies, demos

The agentfront must reflect what the company ACTUALLY is, not what Visa is.

## Template Location
`./template/` relative to this SKILL.md — the skill directory (typically `~/.claude/skills/agentizer/` after install) contains the Next.js template. Content is generated custom per company. After `cp -R`, run the template's `npx next build` once to confirm nothing regressed in the template itself.

## Reference Implementation
**https://wwa.visa.codiris.app** — live demo of a finished agentfront (payment card company). Source for the template is at https://github.com/Humiris/wwa-transform/tree/main/template.

If any template file looks incomplete or broken, inspect the live demo via WebFetch for visual reference, then apply the `visaCards → productItems` / `VisaCard → ProductItem` / `annualFee → price` renames — don't try to fix the template stub in place.

## PHASE 1: Deep Company Intelligence

### Step 1.1: Crawl Multiple Pages

Use `WebFetch` on at minimum:
1. **Homepage** — hero, value prop, main CTAs, navigation
2. **Products/Features page** — what they actually sell
3. **Pricing page** (if exists) — how they charge, what tiers
4. **About page** — company story, mission, stats

For EACH page, ask WebFetch:
```
Extract everything: brand name, tagline, ALL image URLs (full absolute), 
colors (hex from buttons/headers/CSS), navigation items, products/features 
with descriptions, pricing tiers, stats/numbers, customer logos, 
testimonials, CTAs, form fields. Be exhaustive.
```

### Step 1.2: AI Company Analysis

After crawling, THINK deeply about the company. Answer these questions BEFORE writing any code:

**Market Understanding:**
- What industry is this company in? (Fintech, SaaS, E-commerce, Healthcare, etc.)
- Who are their customers? (Developers, Enterprises, Consumers, SMBs)
- What problem do they solve?
- Who are their competitors?

**Product Understanding:**
- What do they sell? (APIs, Physical products, Subscriptions, Services, Cards)
- How many products/tiers do they have?
- How do they charge? (Per-transaction, Subscription, One-time, Usage-based, Free)
- Do they have a free tier or trial?

**Content Structure:**
- What sections make sense for THIS company's homepage?
- What navigation items should exist?
- What categories should products be organized by?
- Should there be a "cards" section? (Only if they sell cards/plans/tiers)
- Should there be a pricing grid? A product catalog? Case studies?

**Value Proposition:**
- What's their main headline?
- What stats are impressive? (Users, revenue, uptime, countries)
- What social proof do they have? (Customer logos, testimonials)

**Typography (CRITICAL — match brand aesthetic):**

The template uses Geist by default. You MUST change fonts to match the brand:

| Brand Type | Fonts to Use | Implementation |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Luxury fashion (Dior, Hermès, Chanel) | Playfair Display + Inter | Serif headings, clean body |
| Tech/SaaS (Stripe, Notion, Linear) | Inter or Geist | Modern sans-serif |
| Premium/Editorial (Apple, Aesop) | SF Pro / Helvetica Neue / system fonts | Clean, minimal |
| Fintech (Visa, Chase) | Geist / Inter | Professional sans |
| E-commerce (Amazon, Walmart) | Inter / Roboto | Readable, utilitarian |

Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:
```tsx
import { Playfair_Display, Inter } from "next/font/google";

const serif = Playfair_Display({ variable: "--font-serif", subsets: ["latin"] });
const sans = Inter({ variable: "--font-sans", subsets: ["latin"] });

// In body: className={`${serif.variable} ${sans.variable} font-sans`}
```

Update `src/app/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --brand-primary: #000000;    /* match brand color */
  --brand-secondary: #C9A96E;
  --font-serif-brand: var(--font-serif), "Didot", "Bodoni MT", "Georgia", serif;
}

h1, h2, .font-serif {
  font-family: var(--font-serif-brand);
  letter-spacing: -0.01em;
}
```

**User Intent (CRITICAL — drives CTAs and modals):**
Analyze what users ACTUALLY do on this site. Map to correct CTA:

| Company Type | Primary Intent | CTA Text | Modal Type |
|--------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| E-commerce (Dior, Nike, Apple) | Shop / Buy products | "Shop Now" | Cart / Product detail |
| SaaS/API (Stripe, Notion) | Try / Book demo | "Start Free" or "Book a Demo" | Demo booking form |
| Enterprise (Salesforce) | Contact sales | "Contact Sales" | Sales form |
| Financial (Visa, banks) | Apply / Get card | "Apply Now" | Application form |
| Marketplace — Listings (Airbnb, Booking, Uber) | Search / Book | "Start Searching" | Search UI |
| Marketplace — C2C (Vinted, Depop, Etsy, eBay) | Sell AND Browse (dual intent) | "Sell Now" + "Start Browsing" | Seller signup modal (personal / pro) |
| Services (Consulting) | Contact / Meeting | "Book a Call" | Calendar booking |
| Content (Netflix, Spotify) | Subscribe / Try | "Start Free Trial" | Signup form |

**NEVER use "Book a Demo" for e-commerce.** E-commerce brands want you to SHOP, not schedule a meeting.

Update these files based on intent:
- `brand-config.ts` → `ctaPrimary` and `ctaSecondary`
- `hero-section.tsx` → button text
- `solution-detail-panel.tsx` → button text
- `book-demo-modal.tsx` → rename, change fields to match intent (e-commerce = Contact Client Services, Cart, or remove entirely)
- `actions.ts` system prompt → what the agent offers users

### Step 1.3: Define the Page Architecture

Based on your analysis, decide which sections the homepage should have. Choose from:

| Section | Use When | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Hero Carousel | Always | Rotating through top products/features |
| Stats Bar | Company has impressive numbers | "$1.9T processed", "99.999% uptime" |
| Product Grid | 3+ distinct products | API products, SaaS modules |
| Pricing Tiers | Clear pricing tiers exist | Free/Pro/Enterprise |
| Feature Showcase | Key differentiators | With images and descriptions |
| Customer Logos | Has notable customers | "Trusted by Amazon, Shopify..." |
| Solution Categories | Products grouped by use case | "For Startups", "For Enterprise" |
| Code Example | Developer-focused company | Interactive code snippet |
| Card Catalog | Sells cards/plans consumers browse | Credit cards, subscription plans |
| CTA Banner | Always | "Book a Demo" / "Get Started" / "Start Free" |
| World Map | Company has global presence story | Payment networks, logistics, international SaaS |

**DO NOT include sections that don't apply:**
- API company → NO credit card tiers, NO card comparison
- E-commerce → NO API docs, NO code examples
- SaaS without global story → NO world map (make `handleShowMap` a no-op in page.tsx)
- Company without browsable products → leave `productItems` array empty, the browse section won't render

---

## PHASE 2: Download Assets

### Step 2.1: Download ALL Images

**MANDATORY.** The agentfront is useless without real images.

> ❗ **The single biggest bug in past transforms** is shipping images from the wrong brand — a generic "sneaker" photo from Unsplash that happens to show a Nike Swoosh on an adidas site, or a "handbag" photo that's clearly Chanel on a Dior site. Mis-branded imagery destroys credibility instantly.
>
> **Rule**: Every image that represents a **specific named product or franchise** (e.g. "Samba OG", "Air Max 90", "Lady Dior") MUST come from a source that lets you verify it shows the correct brand. Generic-category Unsplash photos are banned for these slots. They are OK only for brand-agnostic shots (lifestyle hero, category tiles with no named product, abstract backgrounds).
>
> **And every image MUST pass visual verification (Step 2.3) before you write its path into `cards.ts` / `solutions.ts`.**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/wwa.{domain}/public/images/cards

# Use browser headers to bypass CDN blocks
curl -L -o "public/images/{name}.jpg" "{url}" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36" \
  -H "Referer: https://{domain}/" \
  -H "Accept: image/*"
```

**Download at minimum:**
- Logo (SVG preferred, PNG fallback)
- Hero/banner image
- 1 image per product/solution (6-10 total)
- 2-4 lifestyle/feature images
- Customer logos if available
- Product screenshots/UI images

### Image Source Priority (USE IN THIS ORDER)

**For e-commerce catalogs (fashion retailers, beauty retailers, online-only fashion), always try method 0 FIRST:**

**0. Scrape the brand's SSR catalog JSON via Chrome MCP** — modern e-commerce sites (Zara, H&M, ASOS, Nordstrom, Sephora, etc.) ship the full product grid as a JSON blob inside a `<script>` tag on every category page. Server-side curl gets WAF-blocked, but Chrome MCP with an organic-looking tab has no trouble reading the DOM.

Two flavors to look for:

- **JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">`** (cleanest — H&M, many schemas). Has `@type: Product` entries with `name`, `image[]`, `offers.price` ready to `JSON.parse`.
- **Raw hydration JSON** (Zara, ASOS — biggest `<script>` that contains the brand's CDN hostname). Not always valid JSON; regex out the image URL pattern (e.g. `/static\.zara\.net\/photos\/[^"'\s]+\.jpg/g` or `/products\/[a-z0-9-]+\/\d+-\d+[a-z0-9-]*/gi`) and dedupe by product id.

Pattern that works today (verified on Zara 259 · H&M 216 · ASOS 365 · Uniqlo 54 scrapes):

```js
// In Chrome MCP, navigate to e.g. https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman-dresses-l1066.html, then:
(() => {
  const scripts = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('script'));
  // JSON-LD path (H&M-style): cleanest
  const ld = document.querySelector('script[type="application/ld+json"]');
  if (ld && ld.textContent.includes('"@type":"Product"')) {
    return JSON.parse(ld.textContent);
  }
  // Raw-hydration path (Zara/ASOS): regex
  const big = scripts.find(s => (s.textContent || '').includes('<brand-cdn-hostname>'));
  const text = big.textContent;
  // Adjust regex per brand URL shape
  const urls = [...new Set((text.match(/https:\/\/static\.zara\.net\/[^"'\s]+\.jpg/g) || []))];
  return urls;
})();
```

Then get the result out of Chrome via a `Blob` download:

```js
const blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(catalog)], { type: 'application/json' });
const a = Object.assign(document.createElement('a'), { href: URL.createObjectURL(blob), download: 'catalog.json' });
document.body.appendChild(a); a.click();
// File lands in ~/Downloads/catalog.json — move to project, feed to cards.ts rewrite
```

**Hotlink don't download.** Once you have the URLs, put them directly in `cards.ts`'s `image` field — the browser will load them via `<img src>` (no CORS issue on img tags). No local copy needed. Server-side curl typically fails with 403 / 000 (WAF), but that doesn't matter because production serves from users' browsers.

**For named products/franchises** (Samba, Air Jordan 1, Stan Smith, Lady Dior, Birkin, etc.) where you need individual-product photos not a catalog:

1. Brand's own CDN (works for most sportswear — Nike, adidas, Puma, Asics, New Balance)
2. **Wikipedia / Wikimedia Commons** — the category page `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:{Brand}_{Product}` has real, licensed product photos for every iconic sneaker, boot, bag, watch, perfume, etc.
3. Industry publication CDN for the brand's segment (WWD for fashion, Fragrantica for perfume, SneakerNews/Hypebeast for sneakers)
4. **DROP THE PRODUCT from `productItems`** if none of 1–3 yields a verified photo. A site with 6 real products is infinitely better than a site with 8 and two wrong-brand frauds.

**Unsplash is BANNED for named-product slots.** It's OK only for: hero lifestyle shots (action/atmosphere, no named product), brand-agnostic category tiles, abstract backgrounds. If you use it, still run Step 2.3 verification — generic sneaker/bag photos on Unsplash very frequently show competitor logos.

Most premium brand sites (Dior, Apple, Notion, Vercel, Hermès) AGGRESSIVELY BLOCK curl. Do NOT waste time trying to download from the brand's CDN. Skip directly to the fallback.

**Sportswear CDNs are hit-or-miss** — Puma, Nike, Adidas, Asics, Under Armour, New Balance, Reebok sometimes serve real JPEGs on their public CDNs, but **you have to know the exact style code** and the match rate is worse than you'd expect. Observed on recent transforms:

- **adidas** (`assets.adidas.com`) — returned 0 bytes on every style code tried (Apr 2026)
- **Nike** (`static.nike.com`) — works for some products, requires inspecting a product page's `<img srcset>` to get the right hash
- **New Balance** (`nb.scene7.com`) — works with a Referer header, but style codes are hard to guess; ~50% hit rate even for the most popular models
- **Puma** (`images.puma.com`) — most reliable of the sportswear CDNs

**Rule of thumb**: try the brand CDN once with a single well-known SKU. If it returns real bytes (>20KB), map your remaining products; if it 0-bytes or errors, drop straight to Wikimedia Commons. Don't spend 10 minutes guessing style codes.

| Brand | CDN pattern | How to get the `{styleId}` |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Puma | `https://images.puma.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_800,h_800/global/{styleId}/01/sv01/fnd/PNA/fmt/png/{slug}` | The number after `/pd/slug/` on a product page |
| Nike | `https://static.nike.com/a/images/t_PDP_1280_v1/f_auto,q_auto:eco/{hash}/{slug}.jpg` | Inspect a product page's `<img srcset>` |
| Adidas | `https://assets.adidas.com/images/w_600,f_auto,q_auto/{styleId}/{slug}.jpg` | Often blocked — try once, fall back to Wikimedia |
| New Balance | `https://nb.scene7.com/is/image/NB/{styleId}_nb_02_i?wid=1200&hei=1200` | Match the style id on the product page (e.g. `m1906rcd`) |

Always include `-H "Referer: https://{brand-domain}/"` — the Cloudinary-style CDNs behind most sportswear brands accept the request with referrer, 404 it without.

**Remember**: even when the CDN works, you still MUST run Step 2.3 visual verification on the downloaded bytes — CDNs occasionally return placeholder/blank images with a 200 status.

**1. Brand's own CDN** (always try first for sportswear/athletic; ~30% of premium luxury sites; skip straight to #3 for most editorial/luxury brands)
```bash
curl -sL -o public/images/{name}.jpg "{url}" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36" \
  -H "Referer: https://{domain}/"
```

**2. Wikipedia / Wikimedia Commons** — works for famous brands, logos, iconic products
```bash
curl -sL -o public/images/brand-logo.svg \
  "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/{path}/{file}.svg" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"
```
Use WebSearch: "{brand} logo SVG wikimedia commons"

**2.5. INDUSTRY PUBLICATIONS — USE THIS FOR FASHION BRANDS**
Fashion/luxury brands block their own CDN, but fashion PUBLICATIONS host real runway photos:

```bash
# WWD (Women's Wear Daily) — 2-3MB runway photos, works without auth
# Pattern: https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/{YYYY}/{MM}/{brand}-{collection}-{location}-GG-{01-80}.jpg

curl -sL -o public/images/runway.jpg \
  "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dior-cruise-2026-rome-GG-01.jpg" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"

# Fragrantica CDN — real perfume bottle photos, works without auth
# Pattern: https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.{perfume_id}.jpg
# Find IDs via WebSearch: "{perfume name} fragrantica"

curl -sL -o public/images/jadore.jpg \
  "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.210.jpg" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"
```

Other working fashion/beauty publication CDNs:
- **wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/** — runway, backstage, beauty product shots
- **fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/** — perfume bottles (Fragrantica)
- **nowfashion.com/wp-content/uploads/** — runway photos
- **showstudio.com/** — editorial fashion content
- **vogue.com/photos/** — often requires auth
- **fashionography.com/wp-content/uploads/** — runway archives

**IMPORTANT:** Sample a couple of images first (~2-3MB each). On macOS use `sips -Z 1200 input.jpg -o output.jpg` to resize before committing.

### Brand Videos for Hero Backgrounds

Many luxury brands have hero video loops that dramatically elevate the feel. Look for them:

```bash
# Brand-hosted videos often work with proper headers
curl -sL -o public/videos/hero.webm "{brand-video-url}" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
  -H "Referer: https://{domain}/"
```

**Finding brand video URLs:**
- Dior: `diorama.dam-broadcast.com/...` — works publicly
- Apple: `apple.com/assets-www/...` — often public
- Most fashion houses have `dam-broadcast` or `.cdn.` video CDNs
- Inspect the brand's homepage for `<video>` or `<source>` tags with `.webm` / `.mp4`
- WebSearch: "{brand} hero video webm" or check Dam broadcast networks

**Implementation in hero-section.tsx:**
```tsx
<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover" poster="/images/hero-image.jpg">
  <source src="/videos/hero.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-black/10 via-transparent to-black/70" />
```

Video hero is essential for luxury brands. Fall back to static image if video can't be obtained. Keep videos under 10MB (resize with ffmpeg if needed).

**American heritage brands (Ralph Lauren, Levi's, L.L. Bean, J.Crew, Tommy Hilfiger) rarely expose public video CDNs.** Plan for a static full-bleed runway or editorial hero with a subtle 1.04 scale-on-mount or parallax effect instead — don't waste time hunting for a video that isn't there.

**3. Unsplash (MANDATORY FALLBACK — always works, real product photos)**
```bash

```

> **Unsplash ID format caveat:** stick to the timestamp-hex pattern (`photo-1508685096489-7aacd43bd3b1`). Modern Unsplash URLs use slug-style IDs (`hEIHXXic3yI`) that **do NOT work** with `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{slug}`. If an ID you find is 11 random characters instead of the classic timestamp-hex form, you need the old numeric pattern or the image will 404.

**Verify downloads:** Check file size with `ls -la`. Files under 1KB are failures. Failed downloads return ~29 bytes (Unsplash not-found) or ~300 bytes (error page). Re-download with different ID if under 1KB.

**4. Placehold.co** — LAST RESORT ONLY if Unsplash also fails
```bash
curl -sL -o public/images/{name}.jpg "https://placehold.co/800x400/{hex_no_hash}/white?text={Product}"
```

### Required Downloads

Every project MUST have (minimum):
- Logo (SVG from Wikipedia or brand CDN)
- Hero image (brand or category-matched Unsplash)
- 1 image per solution (category-matched Unsplash)
- 1 image per product (category-matched Unsplash)
- Favicon from `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain={domain}&sz=64`

### Catalog size — minimum item count per brand type (REQUIRED)

A thin catalog kills the demo. Every e-commerce, retail, or fashion brand transform MUST ship at least **100 real product items** spread across the brand's natural segments. The agent needs enough depth to recommend and compare realistically; an 8-item catalog makes every filter / category / chat prompt dead-end immediately.

| Brand type | Minimum items | Split guidance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Fashion mono-brand (Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Ralph Lauren, Dior RTW) | **100+** | 40 Woman / 30 Man / 15 Kids / 10 Accessories / 5 Home — adjust to brand reality |
| Fashion multi-brand retailer (Nordstrom, Net-A-Porter, Farfetch, Zalando) | **150+** | 50 Woman / 40 Man / 25 Kids / 20 Shoes / 15 Bags — plus 20+ brand catalogue entries |
| Beauty multi-brand retailer (Sephora, Ulta, LookFantastic) | **120+** | 30 Skincare / 30 Makeup / 25 Fragrance / 15 Hair / 10 Body / 10 Men — plus 20+ brands |
| Beauty mono-brand (L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, MAC) | **80+** | 25 Skincare / 25 Makeup / 15 Fragrance / 10 Hair / 5 Men |
| Outerwear / Technical (Canada Goose, Arc'teryx, Patagonia) | **60+** | 25 Men / 20 Women / 10 Kids / 5 Accessories — fewer items OK because parkas are expensive/curated |
| Luxury mono-brand (Hermès, Chanel — no RTW catalog online) | **50+** | Scale to what's published; bags + fragrance + leather small goods heavy |
| Sportswear (Nike, Puma, Adidas, Under Armour) | **100+** | 30 Men / 30 Women / 20 Kids / 15 Footwear / 5 Accessories |
| Marketplace listings (Airbnb, Booking) | **100+ stays × 40+ destinations** | destinations.ts covers the cities, cards.ts covers the stays |
| Marketplace C2C (Vinted, Depop, Etsy) | **80+ feature tiles + category mock listings** | cards.ts holds features/flows, not individual listings |
| Fintech / SaaS | 6-12 products is fine | Few products is brand-accurate (Visa has ~8 tiers, Stripe has ~10 products) |

**How to reach 100+ on an e-commerce transform:**
1. Start by listing the brand's real product segments (Woman/Man/Kids/Home/Beauty for Zara; Skincare/Makeup/Fragrance for Sephora). Write the minimum count per segment before downloading images.
2. Scrape representative products from the brand's own site when possible, even if names are paraphrased — the image + name + price + material gives the agent enough to recommend.
3. When the brand CDN blocks (Zara, Dior, etc.), fall through to Unsplash with segment-matched searches. Each segment needs 30+ unique photos; guard against duplicates.
4. Every product entry in `cards.ts` MUST be a real-looking record with: name + price + segment (gender/category) + material/size + badge. Agent recommendations against a half-populated catalog feel hollow.

**Per-section rendering rule (NEW, critical — addresses "there's not a lot of items on Men's" feedback):**

The catalog-size rule above covers `cards.ts` data depth. The **rendering cap** is a separate trap: template components often render `homes.slice(0, 12)` or similar, so even with 100+ items in data, the user sees a thin 8-tile grid.

- **Homepage carousel rows**: 12-16 tiles OK (carousel UX, user scrolls horizontally).
- **Category / gender inner pages** (when user clicks "Men's" or "Woman" from nav or a tile): **MUST render the full filtered catalog, no slice cap.** If the brand has 30 Men's items, the Men's page shows 30, not 12. Minimum per-section display:
  - Woman / Man: 30+ tiles visible on the inner page
  - Kids / Baby: 15+ tiles
  - Accessories / Home / Beauty: 10+ tiles
- **Fix pattern**: in `inner-page.tsx` (or equivalent), the category grid must `productItems.filter(p => p.issuer === gender)` without a trailing `.slice()`. If the page feels too long, use pagination / "Load more" — not a silent truncation.
- Grep check before shipping: `grep -rnE '\.slice\(0,\s*(6|8|12)' src/components/inner-page.tsx src/components/hero-section.tsx src/app/page.tsx` — if caps are present on gender/category paths, they're bugs.

**Quality gate (add to Phase 4 verification):**
- `curl https://wwa.{slug}.codiris.app/mcp -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_products","arguments":{}}}'` → `count: 100+` for any e-commerce brand type.
- Curl the rendered HTML of the Men's / Woman's category pages and count `<img` tags for product tiles. Must be 30+ each (for mono-brand fashion) or 40+ (for multi-brand fashion). If below threshold, UI has a rendering cap that needs removal — the transform is incomplete.

**Post-deploy smoke check (catches stale-alias bugs):** after `vercel alias set`, always re-verify that the alias points to the LATEST deploy. A common failure mode: you fix the code locally, run `npx vercel --prod`, but forget to re-alias — so `wwa.{slug}.codiris.app` continues pointing to the previous (broken) deploy. The Zara/Uniqlo/H&M/ASOS retrofit pass uncovered 4 stale aliases where the uncap code was already correct in git but not reflected live. Always run:

```bash
npx vercel --prod --yes 2>&1 | tee /tmp/deploy.log
DEPLOY_URL=$(grep -oE 'https://[a-z0-9-]+\.vercel\.app' /tmp/deploy.log | head -1)
npx vercel alias set "$DEPLOY_URL" wwa.{slug}.codiris.app
# Then verify:
curl -s https://wwa.{slug}.codiris.app/ | grep -c 'aspect-\[3/4\]\|aspect-\[4/5\]\|aspect-square'  # rough product-tile count
```

**MANDATORY: push API keys from a sibling project before declaring "deployed" (catches silent-AI-fallback bug):** every brand-new Vercel project starts with **zero env vars**. Without `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the AI panel silently falls back to canned `assistant-shared.tsx` strings ("I can help you find..."), and the user thinks the AI is dumb. Caught on the Joivy deploy after the user complained the AI was "stupid". The 200-response on `/api/gemini-key` is the actual smoke check — until that endpoint returns a real key, the demo is broken even if every page renders correctly.

```bash
# Pull keys from any sibling project that already has them (wwa-vinted is reliable)
mkdir -p /tmp/sibling-env && cd /tmp/sibling-env && mkdir -p .vercel
cat > .vercel/project.json << 'EOF'
{"projectId":"prj_eoF8zwRk4i3blOS7Cy95N9Zn5I1s","orgId":"team_CVjPPr2WoqlNcN6zmRDjk04Q","projectName":"wwa-vinted"}
EOF
npx vercel env pull .env.production --environment=production --yes

# Push to the new project via Vercel API
TOKEN=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/Users/joel/Library/Application Support/com.vercel.cli/auth.json')).get('token',''))")
TEAM="team_CVjPPr2WoqlNcN6zmRDjk04Q"
PID=$(cat /tmp/wwa.{slug}/.vercel/project.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['projectId'])")
for k in GEMINI_API_KEY GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY OPENAI_API_KEY; do
  v=$(grep "^${k}=" /tmp/sibling-env/.env.production | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^"//;s/"$//')
  curl -s -X POST "https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/$PID/env?teamId=$TEAM" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.dumps({'key':'$k','value':'$v','type':'encrypted','target':['production','preview','development']}))")"
done

# REDEPLOY + RE-ALIAS so the new envs take effect (env changes don't apply to existing builds)
cd /tmp/wwa.{slug} && npx vercel --prod --yes
# Then alias the new deploy.

# Smoke check — this is the line that proves the AI works:
curl -s -X POST https://wwa.{slug}.codiris.app/api/gemini-key -H "Content-Type: application/json" -w "\n%{http_code}\n"
# Must return {"key":"AIza..."} and HTTP 200. Anything else = AI is silently degraded.
```

### Matching Unsplash Photos to Categories

| Company Type | Use These Photos |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Luxury/Fashion (Dior, Hermès, LV) | Perfume + handbag + lipstick + jewelry + fashion |
| Cosmetics (Sephora, Fenty) | Lipstick + foundation + makeup brushes |
| Tech/SaaS (Stripe, Notion) | SaaS UI screenshots + tech + abstract |
| E-commerce (Amazon, Shopify) | Product shots + packaging + shopping |
| Fintech (Visa, Chase) | Cards + phone + wallet |

### Step 2.2: Download Favicon

```bash
curl -L -o "public/favicon.ico" "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain={domain}&sz=64"
```

### Step 2.3: Visual verification — MANDATORY before writing any image path into `cards.ts` / `solutions.ts`

You are a multimodal model. You can see images. **Use the `Read` tool on every downloaded file** and visually inspect what it actually depicts. Do this BEFORE referencing the image from any data file.

```
Read file_path=/absolute/path/to/public/images/samba.jpg
```

For each image, verify the following before approving it:

1. **Brand match.** If the image represents a named product, does it show the correct brand's logo, wordmark, or trademark graphic?
   - Nike → Swoosh visible and no other brand logos
   - adidas → 3-Stripes and/or Trefoil visible, no Swoosh, no "N", no Brooks, no Puma cat
   - Dior → "Dior" wordmark or CD monogram
   - Hermès → "H" clasp or Kelly/Birkin silhouette with Hermès marking
   - Apple → Apple logo, no Samsung/Google/other
2. **Product match.** If the image is tied to a specific franchise in `solutions.ts` (e.g. "Air Max"), does the shoe in the photo actually look like an Air Max (visible Air unit) vs. a random sneaker?
3. **No competitor logos.** If you can see **any** competitor's logo anywhere in the frame (even on a background wall, a bystander's shirt, the box the product is sitting on), reject the image.
4. **No off-brand props.** A Nike shoebox in the corner of an adidas product shot → reject.

**If verification fails**, in order:

1. Retry with a different source from the priority list (Wikimedia Commons almost always has a clean product shot).
2. If still no luck, **remove that product from `productItems` / that franchise from `solutions`** rather than ship the bad image.
3. NEVER "just swap the filename" and hope — the file on disk is what ships.

**Checklist to run at the end of Phase 2:**

```bash
# List every image file with its size
ls -la public/images/*.jpg public/images/*.png public/images/*.svg 2>/dev/null
```

Then, for EACH non-logo image, use `Read` on it and log either `VERIFIED: shows real <brand> <product>` or `REJECTED: shows <what-it-actually-is>`. If any rejected image is still referenced from `cards.ts` / `solutions.ts`, **you have failed this step** — fix it before proceeding to Phase 3.

**For sizing**: if an image is ≥ 3MB, resize on macOS with `sips -Z 1200 input.jpg -o output.jpg` or `sips -Z 1200 --setProperty formatOptions 80 input.jpg -o output.jpg` to keep page weight reasonable.

---

## PHASE 3: Build the Project

### Step 3.1: Copy Framework

```bash
# From inside the cloned skill (typically ~/.claude/skills/agentizer):
mkdir -p ~/wwa.{domain}
cp -R ./template/. ~/wwa.{domain}/
cd ~/wwa.{domain} && npm install
```

Do NOT copy from absolute maintainer paths like `/Users/joel/wwa-skill/template/` — that path only exists on the maintainer's machine. Always copy `./template/.` relative to the skill directory that contains this SKILL.md.

**Template naming:** The template uses `ProductItem`/`productItems` (not VisaCard/visaCards) as generic names for browsable items. The navbar component is `brand-navbar.tsx`, the map is `world-map.tsx`. All imports in page.tsx already use these names.

### Step 3.1b: Sweep Visa color tokens (MANDATORY, run once, before everything else)

The template ships with Visa's blue (`#1A1F71`), navy hover (`#141963`), and light blue (`#1434CB`) hardcoded in ~8 components — `solution-detail-panel.tsx`, `solution-slider.tsx`, `generated-view.tsx`, `agent-panel.tsx`, `account-panel.tsx`, `live-session-overlay.tsx`, and others. **Delegating component rewrites to parallel subagents always leaves some of these files unedited**, and the Step 3.6 audit catches it every time. Save yourself the re-roll — run this sweep FIRST, right after `cp -R ./template/.`:

```bash
cd ~/wwa.{domain}

# Replace Visa blue (primary), navy (hover), and light blue (accent) with brand colors.
# Pick hex codes that match your brand-config.ts primary/secondary/accent.
find src -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs sed -i '' \
  -e 's/#1A1F71/{BRAND_PRIMARY}/g' \
  -e 's/#141963/{BRAND_PRIMARY_DARK}/g' \
  -e 's/#1434CB/{BRAND_ACCENT}/g'

# Verify zero remaining
grep -rn "#1A1F71\|#141963\|#1434CB" src/
```

Example for a black-primary brand: replace with `#000000`, `#000000`, `#CF0A2C`. For Dior (gold on black): `#0A0A0A`, `#000000`, `#C9A96E`.

After the sweep, subagents can focus on rewriting content (copy, data) without worrying about color hunts. Re-run the grep at the end of Phase 3 to confirm nothing crept back in.

### Step 3.2: Write Brand Config

Write `src/lib/brand-config.ts` with ALL company data from Phase 1. This drives the entire app.

### Step 3.3: Write Solutions Data

Write `src/lib/solutions.ts` — these are the company's ACTUAL products/services. Each must have:
- Real name, real description from their website
- Real features from their product pages
- Image pointing to downloaded file
- Appropriate category for THIS company (not Visa's categories)

### Step 3.4: Write Products/Cards Data (ONLY IF APPLICABLE)

Write `src/lib/cards.ts` — ONLY if the company sells browsable items (plans, cards, products with prices).

**For API companies (Stripe, Twilio):** Use pricing tiers as "cards" — Free, Growth, Enterprise
**For e-commerce (Nike, Apple):** Use actual products as cards
**For SaaS (Salesforce, HubSpot):** Use subscription plans as cards
**For companies with no browsable products:** Leave the array EMPTY and the browse section won't show

### Step 3.5: Rewrite EVERY Content Component

**CRITICAL: Do not sed-replace. REWRITE each file understanding the company.**

**`src/components/hero-section.tsx`** — Rewrite completely:
- Stats must be THIS company's real stats
- "Card Tiers" section: REMOVE if company doesn't have tiers. Replace with what makes sense (e.g., "Choose your plan", "Explore by use case", customer logos grid)
- "Why {Brand}" section: Write real value props from their website, not Visa's
- "Find your card" CTA: Change to whatever CTA makes sense ("Start Building", "Get Started", "Shop Now", "Request Demo")
- Hero images should use downloaded images

**`src/components/inner-page.tsx`** — Rewrite ALL pages:
- Navigation pages must match THIS company's nav (from brand-config)
- Each page content must be written from crawled data
- Remove any pages that don't apply (Stripe doesn't need "Travel" or "Personal")
- Add pages that DO apply (Stripe needs "Developers", "Pricing")

**`src/components/wwa-panel.tsx`** — Update:
- SUGGESTIONS array: Write 6-8 suggestions relevant to THIS company
- Card/solution detection keywords: Based on THIS company's product names
- Chat tab label: "{Brand} Agent"
- Category labels in browse section

**`src/components/assistant-shared.tsx`** — Rewrite ALL fallback responses:
- Every response must be about THIS company's products
- Use real product names, real features, real pricing
- Reference actual pages/docs from their website

**`src/app/actions.ts`** — **Always a full rewrite, regardless of peer clone.** Both the chat `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and the `CODE_GEN_PROMPT` bake brand knowledge in deep (named buildings, founding years, signature products, ambassadors, specific exhibition venues) that a simple `grep "ralph\|polo"` misses. Example: a Ralph Lauren → Zara peer clone caught the obvious brand names but left phrases like "Rhinelander Mansion", "1978 fragrance launches", "Jack Shainman Gallery" in the system prompt — these shipped silently until end-to-end prompt re-read. Re-read this file line-by-line after any peer clone.
- Identity: "{Brand} Agent" specialist in their actual domain
- Product knowledge from crawled data
- Stats from their actual numbers
- Zero references to any prior brand's specific places, years, products, people, or institutions — these don't grep cleanly

**`src/app/page.tsx`** — Update:
- Category grid: Use THIS company's actual categories (not Travel/Cash Back/Business)
- Section titles and descriptions
- Remove any sections that don't apply

**`src/components/book-demo-modal.tsx`** — Update:
- Product interests: THIS company's actual products
- Company types relevant to their market
- Form copy

For **luxury e-commerce / heritage brands**, rewrite the whole modal as "Request a Private Appointment" with three fields — the B2B fields (company size, revenue range, country dropdown, SKU picker) are inappropriate. Keep it short:
- Name + email
- Preferred boutique (dropdown of real flagships from brand-config / flagships.ts)
- Occasion + interests (free text — "wedding gift", "wardrobe refresh", "home", etc.)
Submit CTA: "Request Appointment" — not "Book a Demo".

**`src/components/live-session-overlay.tsx`** — CRITICAL:
- Replace the SVG logo paths (appears 2 times: header + animated center) with the brand's logo
- Update the viewBox to match the brand's SVG
- The voice call should show the BRAND logo, not any other brand

**`src/components/assistant-shared.tsx`** — CRITICAL:
- The `EmptyState` component shows welcome screen with brand logo
- The logo IS the call button — clicking it starts the voice call. NO separate "Start Voice Call" text button
- Pattern: `<button onClick={onOpen}><img src="/images/brand-logo.svg" /></button>`
- Must use brand's logo image file (not inline SVG — renders badly)

**`src/components/agent-panel.tsx`** — CRITICAL (often forgotten):
- Rename ALL skill names: "visa-search" → "{brand}-search", etc.
- Rename CLI commands: "visa-agent" → "{brand}-agent"
- Rename MCP package: "visa-agent-mcp" → "{brand}-agent-mcp"
- Update AgentNet command: "agentnet add {brand}-agent"
- Update skill descriptions to match brand's products
- Update CLI example commands to be relevant to brand
- MCP URL and Claude Code/Codex install commands read from `BRAND.mcpUrl` + `BRAND.mcpServerName` automatically — no string edits needed here as long as brand-config is correct.

**`src/app/mcp/route.ts`** — REAL MCP ENDPOINT (ships with template):
- The template serves a working MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp` on the same origin as the agentfront. JSON-RPC 2.0, stateless, CORS-enabled.
- Default tools read from `productItems` (cards.ts) and `solutions` (solutions.ts): `search_products`, `compare_products`, `get_product`, `get_solutions`, `recommend_product`.
- The `mcpTools` list shown in agent-panel.tsx is already synced with these 5 default tools.
- To add brand-specific tools (e.g. `find_boutique` for luxury, `compare_tiers` for financial, `estimate_fees` for SaaS): append to the `TOOLS` array and add a `case` in `callTool`. Mirror the addition in agent-panel's `mcpTools` list.
- **Brand-config keys to set:**
  - `mcpUrl`: `"https://wwa.{brand}.codiris.app/mcp"` (same origin as deployed agentfront)
  - `mcpServerName`: `"{brand}-agent"` (CLI identifier for `claude mcp add`)
- **Verify after deploy:** `curl -X POST https://wwa.{brand}.codiris.app/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'` — must return the tool list with 200.
- **Recommended brand-specific tools by type** (append to `TOOLS` in route.ts and to `mcpTools` in agent-panel.tsx):
  - Heritage brand (Ralph Lauren, Rolex, Hermès, Patek Philippe): `get_heritage(yearFrom?, yearTo?)` from `src/lib/heritage.ts`, `find_flagship(city?, country?)` from `src/lib/flagships.ts`
  - Multi-house luxury group (Dior, Chanel, Armani): `get_houses()`, `get_house(id)`
  - Restaurant / hospitality arm (Ralph Lauren Polo Bar, Bulgari hotels, Armani Caffè): `find_restaurant(city?)`
  - SaaS with usage pricing (Stripe, Twilio): `estimate_cost(usage)`, `check_availability(region)`
  - Fintech with tiered benefits (Visa, Mastercard, Amex): `compare_tiers(tiers[])`
  - Luxury fragrance house: `get_fragrance_notes(productId)`, `find_boutique(city?)`
  - Marketplace / C2C (Vinted, Depop, Etsy, eBay): `list_markets(region?)`, `list_categories()`, `get_seller_flow(personal|pro)`, `estimate_fees(price, category)` — sellers and buyers want different info from the same API, and marketplaces have operational data (markets live, fee structure) that doesn't fit search/compare/recommend alone.
  - Marketplace / Listings (Booking, Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia, Agoda): `search_stays(destination?, checkIn?, checkOut?, guests?, category?, priceMax?)` returning mocked stay results with price/currency/rating/reviewCount (no need to hit real inventory APIs), `list_destinations(region?, country?)` backed by `src/lib/destinations.ts`, and optionally `get_host_flow()` for the host-onboarding path.
  - Marketplace / Rentals — Residential (Joivy, Spotahome, HousingAnywhere, Uniplaces): `search_rentals(city?, duration_months?, room_type?, max_rent?, available_from?)` — different param shape from `search_stays` (months not nights, single move-in date not check-in/check-out range, room type not category). `find_co_living(city?, age_range?)` translation tool. `book_viewing(propertyId, date)` for tour scheduling — no "reserve" semantics. `get_lease_terms(propertyId)` — minimum lease, deposit, notice period, utilities included. `list_destinations(country?)` backed by `destinations.ts`. Skip `search_stays` / `find_experience` / `find_boutique` — wrong domain.
  - Marketplace / Rentals — Flex (Habyt Flex, Cove, Sonder, Outsite, Mindspace Living, Selina Co-Live): `search_stays(city?, checkIn?, checkOut?, guests?, unitType?, maxRent?, minNights?)` — uses **check-in/check-out range** like Booking, NOT residential-style `duration_months`. Listings carry both per-night AND per-month prices (`nightlyRent` + `monthlyRent` fields). `find_flex_living(preference)` translation tool. `book_stay(propertyId, checkIn, checkOut, guests)` supports days OR months in one tool — NOT `book_viewing`. `get_lease_terms(propertyId)` repurposed for stay terms (free-cancellation window, min nights). `get_living_spaces(propertyId)` for amenities/common-area inventory (rooftop, café, gym, coworking). Skip `search_rentals` / `find_co_living` / `book_viewing` — those are residential-only, wrong domain.
  - Retail / Multi-brand (Sephora, Nordstrom, Net-A-Porter, Farfetch): `list_brands(category?, featuredOnly?)` backed by `src/lib/brands.ts`, `find_shade_match(undertone?, coverage?, finish?)` for beauty, `get_routine(skinType?, concern?, budget?)` for skincare, `get_fragrance_notes(productId)` backed by `src/lib/fragrances.ts`. Extend `search_products` with a `brand?` arg — customers ask "foundations from Rare Beauty under €50" and the default signature doesn't support that.
  - Outerwear / Technical (Canada Goose, Arc'teryx, Moncler, The North Face, Patagonia): `check_warmth(temperature_c, activity)` — a **translation tool** (conditions → product); `compare_parkas(ids[])` extended for fill-power/weight/TEI spec axes; `get_heritage(yearFrom?, yearTo?)` from `heritage.ts`; `find_store(city?, country?)` for flagships with `note` field carrying experiential-retail differentiator ("Cold Room", "Pinnacle Room", "Worn Wear repair"); `get_sustainability(productId?)` returning sourcing + materials detail. Extend `search_products` with `gender?` and `tei?` args.
  - Fashion editorial-minimalist (Zara, COS, ARKET, & Other Stories, Massimo Dutti): `list_collections()` — parallel capsule sub-lines from `src/lib/collections.ts`; `find_fit(bodyShape?, occasion?, season?)` translation tool (sibling to `check_warmth`); `get_size_guide(category, gender)` returning EU/UK/US matrices — **new MCP tool pattern** for any mass-fashion brand with real size charts. Skip for luxury (bespoke) and beauty (shades instead). Extend `search_products` with `gender?`, `collection?`, `material?`.
  - Fashion mass-market pop (H&M, Uniqlo, Gap, Mango, Primark, Forever 21): same core tool set as editorial-minimalist, PLUS extend `search_products` with a **`tech?` arg** for proprietary material technologies (HEATTECH / AIRism / Supima / Ultra Light Down / BlockTech for Uniqlo; CONSCIOUS / Recycled / Organic Cotton for H&M). Critical because customers ask "HEATTECH base layer for -10°C" and the natural query needs the tech axis to resolve — don't overload `material` with it.
  - Fashion marketplace online (ASOS, Shein, Nasty Gal, Boohoo): `list_brands(category?, featuredOnly?)` backed by `src/lib/brands.ts`; `list_collections()` for own-label sub-lines; `find_fit(bodyShape?, occasion?, season?, sizeRange?)` — extend with sizeRange for size-inclusive brands; `get_size_guide(category, gender, sizeRange?)` — per-range cut measurements (curve cut ≠ petite cut, not just number); **`check_delivery(postcode?, country?)`** — NEW translation tool for Premier/Prime/Saver eligibility (service-eligibility translator, sibling to `check_warmth`). Extend `search_products` with `brand?`, `gender?`, **`sizeRange?`** (`"curve" | "petite" | "tall" | "maternity" | "standard"`).
  - **NEW TOOL CATEGORY — "translation tools"** (conditions → product): `check_warmth(temp, activity)` is the first. Other candidates across brand types: footwear `check_fit(usSize, width, foot-shape)`; skincare `check_compatibility(drug, pregnancy)`; luggage `check_airline_allowance(airline, class)`. These are neither `search` nor `recommend` nor `compare` — they translate external conditions into product filters. Document as a sibling to the three classic MCP verbs.

**`src/lib/brand-config.ts`** — Logo:
- Download logo via WebSearch: "{brand} logo SVG wikipedia" or "{brand} press kit"
- Set `logoSvg: ""` and `logoImage: "/images/brand-logo.svg"`
- ALWAYS prefer logo image file over inline SVG to avoid rendering issues

**`src/components/world-map.tsx`** — Update stats or remove if not relevant

**`src/components/card-3d.tsx`** — ONLY for credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard). 
- For ALL other companies: the template already uses product image cards instead of Card3D
- The `cards-browse-panel.tsx` and `wwa-panel.tsx` CardCarousel show product images with name/price overlay
- Do NOT use Card3D for fashion, SaaS, e-commerce, or any non-card company — it renders a credit card with chip and magnetic stripe
- The file contains hardcoded Visa SVG paths and a `1-800-VISA` customer-service phone. Even if the component is never rendered, the audit grep will still flag those strings. For non-card brands, either **delete `card-3d.tsx` entirely** or scrub the hardcoded Visa strings before running the audit.
- **Specific residue check** — `template/src/components/wwa-panel.tsx` line ~68 still renders `<Card3D card={card} size="sm" onClick={...} />` inside the `CardCarousel` component. Every non-card transform MUST replace that line with a photo tile (e.g. `<img src={card.image} .../>` wrapped in a button). Confirmed on Airbnb sim — the template ships with this leak and it has to be edited in-place.

**`src/components/cards-browse-panel.tsx`** — PRODUCT DETAIL VIEW (non-credit-card companies):

The template has credit-card-specific labels throughout the detail view. You MUST rewrite ALL of these for non-card brands:

| Credit-card term | E-commerce/SaaS replacement |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| "Back to Cards" | "Back to Products" / "Back to Collection" |
| "Issued by" | "From" / remove for brand-native products |
| "Annual fee:" | "Price:" |
| "Card Tier" | "Collection" / "Tier" / "Plan" |
| "Card Highlights" | "Product Highlights" / "Features" |
| "Card Details" | "Details" / "Specifications" |
| "REWARDS / WELCOME BONUS / APR" | Remove entirely — not applicable |
| "Ready to apply?" | "Ready to shop?" / "Ready to get started?" |
| "Apply Now" | "Add to Bag" / "Buy Now" / "Subscribe" |
| "Compare Other Cards" | "Explore Collection" / "Continue Shopping" |
| "Application Submitted!" | "Order Confirmed!" / "Welcome!" |
| "Quick application with instant decision" | "Complete your purchase" / "Get started in seconds" |
| "Browse More Cards" | "Continue Shopping" / "Explore More" |
| "Annual Income *" | "Shipping Notes" / remove |
| "credit history" | Remove the credit check reference entirely |
| `{annualFee}/yr` | `{price}` |
| "Secure Application" | "Secure Checkout" |

Also: the detail view renders the product with a dark gradient background and centered 3D card — change to a white background with image on left + details on right for product-style layout.

**`src/components/hero-section.tsx`** — VISUAL STYLE BY BRAND TYPE:

The default template uses a SaaS/tech aesthetic (split layout, colored gradient tiles, tech-y feature grid). This is WRONG for luxury/editorial brands. Adapt per brand:

**LUXURY / EDITORIAL — FRENCH / EUROPEAN (Dior, Hermès, Chanel, Gucci, Aesop):**
- **Hero**: Full-bleed image or video, black/white overlay, centered text, serif heading, no split
- **CTAs**: Square buttons (no rounded-full), white-on-image, "Discover" / "Shop the Collection"
- **Stats**: Minimal, no gradient background, serif numbers, uppercase labels with wide tracking
- **Collections**: Large 2-col tiles with full product imagery, gradient overlay, serif headings
- **Category grid**: Aspect 4:5 tiles with real product images as backgrounds (NOT colored gradients)
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display / Didot-style serif for all headings
- **Typography**: `tracking-[0.3em]` on uppercase labels, `font-normal` (not bold) on headings
- **Colors**: Black, white, cream, gold — no blue/purple accents
- **Motion**: Slow, gentle (1-2s transitions), long fade-ins

**FASHION — EDITORIAL MINIMALIST (Zara, COS, ARKET, & Other Stories, Massimo Dutti):**

Mono-brand mono-color fashion with rapid-turn seasonal drops, no heritage narrative, maximal typography contrast. The pure-B&W editorial-gallery aesthetic. Distinct from its mass-market cousin (H&M / Uniqlo / Gap / Mango) which uses color-friendly pop aesthetics.

- **Palette**: **pure black + pure white, NO accent color**. This is the signature — monochrome is the brand. Don't use the Visa-navy / Sephora-red / any-color pattern; resist the instinct to add an accent. Zara's brand voice IS the restraint.
- **Typography**: **condensed elongated display serif** for headlines (free equivalents: `Big Shoulders Display`, `Oswald`, `Abril Fatface` — pick the one that matches the brand's wordmark shape). Inter or Helvetica for body. The *contrast* between massive display headlines and tiny body copy is the brand signature — don't temper it.
- **Hero**: oversized display text (4-8 rem+) over a **single** full-bleed editorial photo. NOT a carousel (RL/Dior pattern), NOT a search form (marketplace), NOT a split (SaaS). One big photo, scroll for the next editorial block. Massive negative space between sections.
- **Buttons**: sharp-cornered (border-radius 0), uppercase wide-tracking tiny text, black-on-white or white-on-black only. The button text reads `ADD` or `SHOP NOW →` — never more.
- **Navigation**: pure text, tiny size, pure black. The navbar is lean — Woman / Man / Kids / Home / Beauty / Join Life or similar brand-specific top facets. No icons, no dropdowns.
- **Product grid**: large rectangular tiles, no pills, no "guest favorite" badges, no discount flags during a normal season. Just photo + product name + price.
- **Product detail view** — DISTINCT from all other sub-types:
  - Huge display-serif product name (not bold sans, not Didot — the condensed elongated serif)
  - Price: small but bold, under the name. No strikethrough unless genuinely on sale.
  - **Size picker = single `<select>` dropdown**, not a grid (Zara does this deliberately — minimalism)
  - Color chips: small circles, inline
  - **Single "ADD" button**, no "Wishlist", no "Request consultation" — just ADD
  - Body-copy paragraph (not an accordion) with material + care text
  - "YOU MAY ALSO LIKE" row at bottom
  - No trust badges, no reviews, no "Recommended for you" personalization chrome
- **Animations**: restrained — quick fades only. NO scale-on-hover, NO slide-ins. The minimalism applies to motion too.
- **Collection sub-lines**: most editorial-fast-fashion brands run 4-8 parallel sub-capsules (Zara's Main/Studio/SRPLS/Origins/TRF/Limited Edition/Athleticz/Join Life; Uniqlo's Main/U/C/J; H&M's Main/Studio/Home/Conscious). Add `src/lib/collections.ts` + a `list_collections()` MCP tool — these don't map onto gender/category axes.
- **MCP tools** specific to editorial-minimalist fashion:
  - `list_collections()` — parallel capsule sub-lines from `collections.ts`
  - `find_fit(bodyShape?, occasion?, season?)` — translation tool (sibling to Canada Goose's `check_warmth`; conditions → curated picks)
  - `get_size_guide(category, gender)` — EU/UK/US size matrix with measurements. This is a **new MCP tool pattern** for any mass-fashion brand with real size charts (Zara, Uniqlo, H&M, Gap, ASOS). Luxury brands skip it (bespoke); beauty retailers skip it (shades instead).
  - `find_store(city?, country?)` — flagship physical presence

**FASHION — MASS-MARKET POP (H&M, Uniqlo, Gap, Mango, Primark, Forever 21):**

Cousin to editorial-minimalist but color-friendly and accessible. Distinguished from Zara/COS/ARKET by: bold brand accent color (H&M red, Uniqlo red, Gap navy), pop-magazine aesthetic (pink/olive/cream seasonal backgrounds, NOT pure B&W), entry-level pricing (£4.99–£14.99 basics vs Zara's £19.95 floor), youth-dedicated sub-line (H&M's Divided, Gap's Teen), and first-class Baby + Home categories.

- **Palette**: brand-color primary + accessible pastels. H&M red `#E50010`, Uniqlo red `#E30A18`, Gap navy `#00256C`, Mango camel. Seasonal backgrounds use soft pink / olive / cream / camel — a color accent is expected and welcome (opposite of the Zara rule).
- **Typography**: **bold chunky sans** (Inter Bold Extended, Helvetica Bold, Noto Sans) — NOT condensed elongated serif. The mass-market signal is confidence and clarity, not editorial drama.
- **Hero**: color-block rotating panels (2-3 panels, each a different hero offer) OR a "shop-by-trend" tile row (Y2K / Boho / Workwear / Festival / Preppy). Multiple narratives surfaced, not a single editorial moment.
- **Navigation** includes: Ladies/Woman, Men, Youth sub-line (Divided/Teen), **Kids, Baby, Home** — Baby and Home are first-class top-nav entries, not nested under Kids/Lifestyle. Uniqlo Baby sizing goes 50-100cm.
- **Product detail view** — like editorial-minimalist but with:
  - Color swatches as prominent circles (not discrete)
  - Size grid XS–XXXL PLUS numerical EU 34-46 both shown
  - **Members price** strikethrough shown ("£29.99 / H&M Member £24.99")
  - Tech-feature badges where applicable (HEATTECH / AIRism / Supima / Ultra Light Down for Uniqlo; CONSCIOUS / RECYCLED / ORGANIC for H&M)
  - Accessible price ladder on every tile (entry + aspirational side-by-side)
- **Product grid** is denser than editorial-minimalist, merch-oriented, with badge flags (NEW / SAVE / BESTSELLER / CONSCIOUS) that would be too loud for Zara but are on-brand here.
- **Loyalty programme** is first-class chrome: H&M Members, Uniqlo IQ, Gap Good Rewards. Surface in the navbar, the PDP price block, and the book-demo-modal (rewrite as loyalty signup per SKILL.md residues).
- **Technical-functional tech features** are product-level filters: Uniqlo's HEATTECH/AIRism/Supima/Ultra Light Down/BlockTech/PUFFTECH. Extend `search_products` with a `tech?` arg so customers can filter by proprietary material tech ("HEATTECH base layer for -10°C"). Don't overload `material` with it.
- **MCP tools** — same as editorial-minimalist plus:
  - `search_products` extended with `tech?` arg (HEATTECH / Supima / CONSCIOUS / Organic Cotton / Recycled)
  - `list_collections()` — Uniqlo's Main/U/C/J/+J/JW Anderson/Marimekko; H&M's Main/Studio/Divided/Conscious Exclusive + designer collabs

**FASHION MARKETPLACE — ONLINE (ASOS, Shein, Nasty Gal, Boohoo, Zalando):**

Pure-play online retailers with substantial own-label catalogues + stocked external brands. Distinct from `RETAIL — MULTI-BRAND` (Sephora / Nordstrom / Net-A-Porter) which are primarily curated external-brand retailers. Distinct from `marketplace-listings` (Booking / Airbnb) which is host-traveler dynamics.

- **Palette**: dark-minimalist with an electric accent. ASOS true black + neon yellow; Shein black + pink; Zalando white + orange. The neon/electric accent is the "online-only youth" signal.
- **Typography**: bold chunky sans with confident presence. Inter Bold Extended or Helvetica Bold Extended.
- **Signature nav pattern** — **size-inclusive top-level entries**: Curve & Plus / Petite / Tall / Maternity as first-class nav categories alongside Women / Men / Kids. This is unique to online-only fashion marketplaces (ASOS pioneered it; Boohoo / Nasty Gal followed). SKIP this for Zalando/Nordstrom/Net-A-Porter which keep size ranges as filter chips instead.
- **Hero**: weekly editorial cover ("Trending now", "Fit of the week", "We're obsessed with…") + a "shop-by-size-range" tile row. Model-led street-style photography, NOT studio white-background.
- **Product detail view**:
  - Prominent brand badge above product name ("NIKE · Air Max 90")
  - Size + fit info block ("Model wears UK 8 / size S, 5'10"") — ASOS-signature
  - Stock indicator ("Only 3 left in size M")
  - Star rating + review count from the brand's own reviews
  - Premier / Prime / Saver delivery eligibility teaser
- **Required `src/lib/brands.ts`** + `list_brands(category?, featuredOnly?)` MCP tool (same convention as multi-brand beauty retail — ASOS stocks 850+ brands).
- **Required `src/lib/collections.ts`** for own-label sub-lines (ASOS Design / Edition / 4505 / Weekend Collective / Made In / Topshop / Topman).
- **MCP tools** — substantial extension:
  - `search_products` extended with `brand?`, `sizeRange?` (`"curve" | "petite" | "tall" | "maternity" | "standard"`), `gender?`
  - `list_brands(category?, featuredOnly?)`
  - `list_collections()`
  - `find_fit(bodyShape?, occasion?, season?, sizeRange?)` — extended with sizeRange
  - `get_size_guide(category, gender, sizeRange?)` — UK/EU/US PLUS per-range cut measurements (curve cut differs from petite cut, not just the number)
  - `check_delivery(postcode?, country?)` — NEW translation tool (conditions → Premier / Saver / Standard eligibility). Sibling to Canada Goose's `check_warmth`. General pattern: a translation tool for service eligibility is a third category beside product-search and product-recommend.

**LUXURY — AMERICAN HERITAGE / PREP (Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, J.Crew, L.L. Bean, Brooks Brothers):**
- **Hero**: Full-bleed runway OR editorial lifestyle photograph (equestrian, sailing, library, cabin interior — NOT Paris-minimalist void). Static image with 1.04 scale-on-mount is fine — most of these brands have no public video CDN.
- **CTAs**: Square buttons, uppercase-wide tracking, "Shop the Collection" / "Request an Appointment" / "Visit the Flagship"
- **Stats**: Minimal, serif numbers, uppercase labels — same as French luxury
- **Collections**: 2- or 3-col grid of portrait 3:4 or 4:5 images with serif captions
- **Fonts**: Caslon / Garamond / Playfair Display — NOT Didot (that reads as French and wrong)
- **Typography**: Wide-tracked uppercase labels in burgundy or navy, italic body for pullquotes, never all-caps long-form
- **Colors**: Navy primary, burgundy accent, cream surface, racing green or tartan secondary, antique gold highlight — avoid stark black/white/gold (that's French)
- **Motion**: Slower than French luxury (1200–1600ms), no scale transforms beyond 1.04

**TECH / SAAS (Stripe, Notion, Linear):**
- Split hero with copy left + product screenshot right
- Colored CTAs (rounded-full), "Start Building" / "Book a Demo"
- Stats on dark background with bold numbers
- Feature grid with icons (not images)
- Code snippets as visual elements

**CONSUMER (Apple, Nike, Spotify):**
- Full-bleed hero with big bold text, keep sans-serif
- Single prominent CTA, bold colors
- Product-focused imagery, minimal copy

**FINTECH / FINANCIAL (Visa, Chase, Robinhood):**
- Keep current template style (split, colored tiers, card visuals)
- Blue/navy color palette
- Stats-heavy design, trust signals

**MARKETPLACE / C2C (Vinted, Depop, Etsy, eBay, Poshmark):**
- **Hero**: carousel of category solutions with lifestyle photography (real people + items — NOT isolated product shots). Hero copy is short and action-oriented ("Dresses, tops, denim, and outerwear — secondhand").
- **CTAs**: dual-intent, always two buttons — primary "Sell Now" (solid brand color) + secondary "Start Browsing" (outline or darker brand color). Never "Shop Now" alone; a marketplace's sellers are half the audience.
- **Stats bar**: members / markets / lifetime GMV / seller-fees. Example from Vinted: "80M+ Members · 26 Markets · €10.8B Annual GMV · 0% Selling fees". The zero-fees or low-fees stat is often the single most persuasive number — lead with it if true.
- **Navigation**: the brand's real category tree (Women / Men / Designer / Kids / Home), plus a "Sell" item that routes to the seller flow.
- **Feature tiles** (instead of product grid): Buyer Protection, Ship Fast, Designer Authentication, Bundle Discounts, Zero Fees, Wallet — these are *trust & flow* features, not products.
- **Fonts**: utility sans-serif (Inter, Geist). Marketplaces are utility-first; serif reads luxury and is wrong.
- **Colors**: most marketplaces use a single bold color (Vinted teal `#09B1BA`, Depop red, Etsy orange, Poshmark pink). Use the brand color boldly — stats band, hero CTAs, feature icons.
- **No `book-demo-modal` in the classic B2B shape** — see the marketplace variant in the `book-demo-modal.tsx` guidance below.

**MARKETPLACE / LISTINGS (Booking, Airbnb, VRBO, Trivago, Expedia, Hotels.com, Agoda):**

Similar to C2C marketplaces but asymmetric — travellers/buyers are the primary audience, hosts/sellers are the B-side. Different hero + CTA pattern:

- **Hero**: large photographic hero (city skyline / destination / accommodation) with a **search form overlay** — not a static CTA button. The search form IS the primary interaction. Standard fields: destination, check-in, check-out, guests.
- **CTAs — asymmetric, NOT dual-intent**:
  - Primary: "Search Stays" / "Find a Hotel" / "Search Flights" — large, solid brand color, near the search form
  - Secondary: "List Your Property" / "Become a Host" — small outline button in nav or footer, routes to a host-onboarding modal
  - Do NOT paste dual CTAs side-by-side like C2C. The search form is a primary-heavy pattern.
- **Two signature grids** — SHIP BOTH on the homepage:
  1. **Trending inventory grid** — 18-26 tiles of individual stays/cities/routes with real photography (Paris boutique, Tokyo capsule, Santorini cave, Maldives villa). Each tile shows image + name + price indicator ("from €180/night") + city label.
  2. **Destinations / categories grid** — 24-36 tiles of countries/cities/regions with iconic destination photos (Eiffel, skyline, monument). Each tile shows image + destination name + property count ("12,450 stays").
  - Both grids are what travellers actually scroll through. Skipping either breaks the marketplace feel.
- **Stats bar**: properties / countries / languages / support. Example from Booking: "3M+ Properties · 220+ Countries · 40+ Languages · 24/7 Support".
- **Navigation**: Hotels · Apartments · Villas · Hostels · B&Bs · Holiday homes · Resorts · plus "List your property" as the host entry.
- **`src/lib/cards.ts` repurposing**: the 9-15 `productItems` represent stay categories (Hotels/Apartments/Villas/etc.), NOT individual properties — the same repurposing convention as C2C features but with category shape.
- **Optional `src/lib/destinations.ts`**: listings marketplaces almost always have a destinations catalog. Create this file with `{ id, city, country, region, heroImage, propertyCount }[]` and wire a `list_destinations(region?)` MCP tool to it. Vinted uses `list_markets(region?)` for country markets; Booking uses `list_destinations(region?)` for cities; Uber would use `list_cities(country?)`. Same shape, different primary axis.
- **Optional `src/lib/experiences.ts`** (for brands that sell **activities** alongside stays — Airbnb Experiences, Klook, Viator, GetYourGuide, Hotels.com Spots): `{ id, city, title, type, price, duration, image }[]`. Experiences aren't stays (no overnight axis) and aren't destinations (they're bookable events) — they need their own dataset. Wire a `find_experience(city?, type?)` MCP tool. Skip this file if the brand only sells stays.
- **Premium tier within the marketplace** — Airbnb Luxe, Booking Genius, VRBO Premier Partner, Expedia One Key. These are *tiers-within-the-marketplace* that carry extra service slots (trip designer, pre-stocked pantry, airport transfer, priority support). The flat `productItems[].tier` field in the template captures the label but not the extras. If the premium tier matters to the brand story, create a `premium-tier.ts` with `{ features: string[], amenities: string[], support: string }` and add a fifth MCP tool `get_premium_tier()`. Otherwise just flag the tier with a single card in `productItems` and accept the simplification.
- **Fonts**: utility sans-serif (Inter, Geist). Same as C2C.
- **Colors**: a confident primary color (Booking blue `#003580`, Airbnb red `#FF5A5F`, Expedia yellow `#FFC72C`) — the primary drives the search form, stats bar, and trending grid chrome.

When transforming, EXPLICITLY adapt the hero and category grid to match the brand's visual DNA. Don't just update text — change the layout pattern.

**MARKETPLACE / RENTALS — RESIDENTIAL (Joivy, Spotahome, HousingAnywhere, Uniplaces, The Student Hotel, Kabute, Casavo):**

**Distinct from listings-marketplace (Booking/Airbnb)** — long-term residential rentals (1–24 months), not nightly stays. The vocabulary, pricing model, transaction flow, and visual surfaces are different enough that listings-marketplace guidance leads you wrong. Verified across the Joivy transform.

- **Vocabulary swap (CRITICAL — do a sweep)**:
  - "Stay" → "Rental" or "Tenancy"
  - "Night" / "Nights" → "Month" / "Months"
  - "Check-in / check-out" → "Move-in date / Move-out date"
  - "Guests" → "Tenants" / "Residents" (or "Roommates" for co-living)
  - "Reserve" / "Book this stay" → **"Schedule a viewing"** or "Apply" or "Request a tour"
  - "Free cancellation" → "Lease flexibility" / "Notice period" (typically 30-60 days)
  - "Trip" / "Vacation" → just remove
  - "Hotel" / "Resort" → "Building" / "Residence" / "Apartment block"
- **Hero / search form fields** (different from Booking's destination/check-in/check-out/guests):
  - **City** (dropdown of live markets)
  - **Move-in date** (single date picker, not a range — open-ended duration)
  - **Duration** — radio or pills: 1-3 mo / 3-6 mo / 6-12 mo / 12+ mo
  - **Room type** — Entire studio / 1-bed / Co-living room / Shared apartment / Family suite
  - **Monthly budget** (single slider — €400-€2,500 typical range)
  - Primary CTA: "Find a home" or "Search rentals" — not "Search stays"
- **Stats bar** (different metrics): markets · cities · operating since · average move-in time. Example for Joivy: "8 countries · 50+ cities · since 2007 (DoveVivo) · 24h average viewing booking".
- **`src/lib/cards.ts` repurposing — DIFFERENT FROM LISTINGS**: `productItems` represent **rental categories** (Studio · Co-living room · 1-bed apartment · 2-bed apartment · Student studio · Shared apartment · Family suite · Pro suite), NOT stay categories (Hotels/Villas). Field mapping:
  - `issuer` → city/country (not gender, not house — for residential the city is the primary filter)
  - `tier` → lease duration ("Short-term 1-3 mo" / "Medium 3-6 mo" / "Long-term 6-12 mo" / "Annual 12+ mo")
  - `annualFee` → monthly rent ("€650 / month")
  - `apr` → utilities + furnishing ("Utilities included · Furnished" / "Bills excluded · Unfurnished")
  - `rewardRate` → minimum lease ("3 month minimum")
  - `signUpBonus` → onboarding offer ("First month -50%" / "No deposit" / "Free Wi-Fi" / "Move in same week")
  - `applyUrl` → property URL on the brand's site
- **Property detail view** — **NOT the Airbnb gallery + booking card**. Use:
  - Photo gallery (room + common spaces + building exterior + neighborhood)
  - Header: building name + address + city + monthly rent + utilities-included badge
  - **Lease terms block** (essential — lease duration, deposit amount, notice period, what's included, available-from date)
  - **Building amenities** (Wi-Fi, kitchen, gym, common lounge, washing machine, bike storage)
  - **Nearby** (universities, transit, supermarkets — text list, not just a map pin)
  - **"Schedule a viewing"** primary CTA + "Apply now" secondary
  - No "Reserve" button. No nightly price calculator. No "guests" picker.
- **`src/lib/destinations.ts`** stays useful — same shape as listings-marketplace, just `propertyCount` is larger (Joivy has ~5,000 rooms in Milan).
- **MCP tools** specific to residential rentals:
  - `search_rentals(city?, duration_months?, room_type?, max_rent?, available_from?)` — instead of `search_stays`. Different param shape.
  - `find_co_living(city?, age_range?)` — translation tool (sibling to `check_warmth`, `find_fit`, `check_delivery`). Conditions → property pick.
  - `book_viewing(propertyId, date)` — schedule a tour, NOT a stay reservation.
  - `get_lease_terms(propertyId)` — minimum lease, deposit, notice period, included utilities. Documenting the contract is the equivalent of Booking's "free cancellation" trust signal.
  - `get_property(propertyId)`, `compare_properties(ids[])` — same as listings.
  - **Skip**: `search_stays`, `find_experience`, `find_boutique` — wrong domain.
- **Fonts**: clean sans-serif (Inter, Söhne). Joivy uses ABC Diatype-adjacent.
- **Colors**: residential brands lean toward **trust-warm palettes** — deep teal (Joivy `#015962`), forest green, terracotta, navy. NOT bright vacation-marketing colors (Booking blue, Airbnb red, Expedia yellow). The vibe is "your home", not "your getaway".

**MARKETPLACE / RENTALS — FLEX (Habyt Flex, Cove, Sonder, Mindspace Living, Outsite, Selina Co-Live):**

**Distinct from residential rentals (Joivy)** — flex-living = stays for **days OR months**, not 1+ month minimum. Habyt's pitch is "a stay that moves with you" — book 3 nights or 8 months in the same building, with free cancellation. Verified across the Habyt transform.

- **Vocabulary swap (different from residential)**: keep "stay" and "guests" (NOT "rental" / "tenants"). "Book" or "Book now" (NOT "Schedule a viewing"). "Free cancellation" is the headline trust signal, not "lease flexibility". The whole grammar is closer to extended-stay-hotel than to residential lease.
- **Hero / search form fields** (closer to Booking's stay form than Joivy's rental form):
  - **City** (dropdown of live properties, NOT live cities — flex brands often have just 1-3 active buildings)
  - **Check-in date + Check-out date** (range picker, like Booking) — NOT a single move-in date
  - **Guests** (1-4 typical)
  - **Unit type** — Studio / 1-Bed / 2-Bed / Suite (per-property)
  - Primary CTA: **"Book now"** or **"Search"** — NOT "Find a home" (that's residential).
- **Pricing model — DUAL TIER**: every listing carries BOTH a per-night price (`€95/night`) AND a per-month price (`€1,450/mo`). The PDP and the booking card need to surface both. Discount messaging: "Stay 7+ nights for X% off", "Stay 30+ nights for X% off". `cards.ts` should have `monthlyRent` AND `nightlyRent` fields (or a single `priceTiers` object).
- **Tier mapping** (different from residential): `tier` field becomes the stay-length tier — `"Flex 1-3 nights"` / `"Short stay 7+ nights"` / `"Monthly stay"` / `"Long stay 6+ months"` — instead of lease duration.
- **Property catalog tends to be SMALL**: Habyt Flex has 2 active properties globally (Berlin Waterfront, Truliving Vallecas Madrid). Don't fake a 50-property catalog. Generate 5-10 unit-type variants per real property (different floors, views, slight price spread) for a 20-30 card catalog. Then list "coming soon" cities with `comingSoon: true` flags + a coming-soon UI badge.
- **`destinations.ts` shape**: add `comingSoon: boolean` and `propertyCount: 0` for non-active cities. The world-map and city grid then render those with a muted "Coming soon" treatment instead of a fake property count.
- **MCP tools** specific to flex-living (different signatures from residential):
  - `search_stays(city?, checkIn?, checkOut?, guests?, unitType?, maxRent?, minNights?)` — uses **check-in/check-out range** like Booking, NOT `duration_months` like Joivy. Both nightly + monthly results in one response.
  - `find_flex_living(preference)` — translation tool (sibling to `find_co_living`). Natural-language → property + unit pick. Includes nights vs. months parsing.
  - `book_stay(propertyId, checkIn, checkOut, guests)` — supports days OR months in one tool. NOT `book_viewing`.
  - `get_lease_terms(propertyId)` — repurposed for "stay terms" — free cancellation window (typically 24-48h before), minimum nights, deposit, what's included.
  - `get_living_spaces(propertyId)` — list amenities + common spaces (rooftop pool, café, cinema room, gym, coworking — Habyt Vallecas style).
  - `get_property(propertyId)`, `compare_properties(ids[])`, `list_destinations(country?)` — same as residential.
  - **Skip**: `search_rentals`, `find_co_living`, `book_viewing`, `find_experience` — wrong domain (residential or hotel).
- **No 3D Matterport tours** typically — flex brands lean on photography + video walkthrough instead. The tours.json should be `{}` and `hasTour()` returns false; the PDP's 3D-tour pill must be conditional (`{tourAvailable && <pill/>}`) so it silently disappears, not breaks.
- **Hero subhead**: "A stay that moves with you" / "Flexible living, anywhere you go" / "Book for days or months" — emphasize flexibility, NOT permanence.
- **Trust badges** (real Habyt order): `Free cancellation · Flexible stay · Best price` — these go above the price on the PDP booking card AND on listing tiles.
- **Colors**: flex-living brands lean **darker, more luxurious** than residential — Habyt is forest green `#00271A` + terracotta `#572411` + cream `#FFFBF1`. NOT trust-warm teal (that's residential). The vibe is "boutique extended-stay hotel", not "your home" or "your getaway".
- **Fonts**: same clean modern sans (Inter, Söhne) but allow a serif accent for headings on luxury-skewed flex brands (Habyt uses a humanist sans throughout).

**RETAIL — MULTI-BRAND (Sephora, Nordstrom, Net-A-Porter, Farfetch, Selfridges, MatchesFashion):**

Different from mono-brand luxury (Dior/Hermès) because they stock hundreds of external brands and have to surface those brands as first-class entities. Different from marketplace (Vinted/Airbnb) because they carry real inventory, not user listings.

- **Hero**: large campaign carousel (3-4 slides) with brand collaborations or seasonal themes — less minimalist than luxury, more editorial/commercial.
- **Navigation**: by category (Makeup, Skincare, Fragrance, Hair, Men, Gifts) AND by brand (dedicated "Brands" entry in the nav).
- **Signature sections** on homepage:
  1. Nouveautés / New in — 16+ products
  2. Bestsellers — 16+ products
  3. Shop by category — 6-8 large tiles
  4. Featured brands — horizontal row of 20+ brand cards (logos + "shop the brand")
  5. Curated routine / look builder — 3-4 step walkthrough (Nettoyer → Tonifier → Traiter → Hydrater for beauty)
- **`src/lib/brands.ts`** — REQUIRED for multi-brand retail. `{ id, name, logo, origin, categories[], featured }[]` + `list_brands(category?, featuredOnly?)` MCP tool. Sephora stocks 340+ brands and without this the agent can't answer "what brands do you stock from Korea".
- **Product detail view** — e-commerce shape (NOT Airbnb listing card, NOT credit-card detail):
  - Gallery strip (hero + 3 thumbs; thumbs can repeat with product variants)
  - Brand name (prominent, above title) + product title + star rating + review count + trust badges ("Clean at Sephora", "Cruelty-free", "Vegan")
  - Price row (with strikethrough if discounted)
  - **Shade / swatch picker** — 8-12 color chips with hover labels (required for makeup; skincare skips this)
  - Quantity selector + "Add to bag" / "Ajouter au panier" button in the brand accent color
  - Accordion sections: Ingredients, How to use, Benefits, Reviews
  - "Recommandés pour vous" / "You might also like" — 4-card row filtered to same category
  - No booking card, no application form — pure e-commerce
- **Fonts**: utility sans-serif (Inter / Helvetica Neue). Matches beauty/retail flat-minimalism.
- **Colors**: most beauty retailers use a stark black/white palette (Sephora, Net-A-Porter) with a single accent (Sephora red `#DE1F29`). Tom Ford / Charlotte Tilbury do black + gold. Farfetch does black + editorial color blocks.
- **MCP tools** specific to beauty retail:
  - `list_brands(category?, featuredOnly?)` — filter 340+ brands by category
  - `find_shade_match(undertone?, coverage?, finish?, skinTone?)` — foundation/lipstick recommendation
  - `get_routine(skinType?, concern?, budget?)` — 3-4 step skincare routine
  - `get_fragrance_notes(productId)` — top/heart/base notes per fragrance
  - `search_products` extended with `brand?` and `skinType?` args

**OUTERWEAR / TECHNICAL (Canada Goose, Arc'teryx, Moncler, The North Face, Patagonia, Mammut):**

Mono-brand, premium/luxury, with technical-spec-forward product detail. Sits at the intersection of American heritage (narrative-heavy, made-in-X provenance) and sportswear (gender/fit/activity filter axes). Neither the Dior shape nor the Sephora shape nor the Ralph Lauren shape fits cleanly — it's its own pattern.

- **Hero**: photographic — cold/arctic/mountain landscape with a single figure in the brand's flagship product. Headline anchored in conditions ("Built for the coldest place on earth", "Made for the alpine", "Tested at -40°C"). Primary CTA = "Shop [Flagship Product]"; secondary = "Discover the Heritage".
- **Stats bar**: founding year · Made-in-[country] · Lifetime Warranty · sustainability badge (HUMANE DOWN / RECYCLED / BLUESIGN).
- **Signature sections on homepage**: 1) Shop the flagship product line (16+ tiles with warmth/weight indicator per tile); 2) Explore by collection (Expedition, Black Label, Eco-line, Lightweight); 3) Heritage timeline (wire to `heritage.ts`); 4) "Built for explorers" — 4 story cards featuring real-world users (scientist, mountaineer, ranger, conservationist).
- **Product detail view — NEITHER the Airbnb booking card NOR the Sephora shade picker NOR the credit-card detail**. New shape:
  - Gallery strip (hero + 3-4 thumbs)
  - Breadcrumb: Home > [Gender] > [Category] > [Collection] > [Style]
  - Style name + collection line ("Expedition Parka") + price
  - **Color swatches** (circles, 6-8 colorways) — not shade chips, smaller
  - **Size selector grid** (XS–XXL, with sold-out strikethrough on unavailable)
  - **Warmth / technical rating bar** — horizontal 1-5 scale (Canada Goose TEI, Arc'teryx has similar tier naming, North Face has similar). Label where this product sits.
  - **Trust badge row** — 3 pills like HUMANE DOWN · MADE IN CANADA · LIFETIME WARRANTY
  - Single "Add to Bag" button in brand color
  - Accordions: Details (fill power, shell fabric, weight in g/kg), Sizing, Care, Sustainability
  - "Fit" editorial block (how it's cut)
  - "You might also like" — 4 cards
- **Fonts**: utility sans-serif, often condensed (Helvetica Neue, Inter, Neue Haas).
- **Colors**: the brand's dominant hero color (Canada Goose black, Moncler navy, Patagonia earth-tone) + a single flag-adjacent accent (Canada red, French blue, etc.).
- **MCP tools** specific to outerwear / technical:
  - `check_warmth(temperature_c, activity)` — a **translation tool** (conditions → product suggestion) that's neither search nor recommend nor compare. Pattern: customer asks "what works at -25°C hiking", tool returns TEI band + matching products. **This shape is new** — document it as a category, other brand types will need translation tools too (e.g. shoes "what fits size 10 UK narrow"; skincare "what's safe during pregnancy").
  - `compare_parkas(ids[])` — extended comparison exposing the technical-spec axes (fill power, weight, TEI, shell fabric).
  - `get_heritage(yearFrom?, yearTo?)` — from `heritage.ts`.
  - `find_store(city?, country?)` — flagship + experiential retail; use `flagships.ts`'s `note` field for retail-differentiator metadata ("Cold Room try-on", "Arc'teryx Pinnacle Room", "Patagonia Worn Wear repair").
  - `get_sustainability(productId?)` — sourcing + materials detail; customers ask this more than the other verticals.

**`src/components/wwa-panel.tsx`** — ACCOUNT CREATION FLOW:

The template's account creation asks for "annual income" (makes sense for credit card applications, wrong for everything else). For non-financial brands, replace the income question with something contextually relevant:

| Brand Type | Replace "annual income" with |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Luxury/Fashion | "What categories interest you most? (Fragrance, Bags, Fashion, Jewelry)" |
| E-commerce | "What styles do you prefer?" |
| SaaS | "What's your role/team size?" |
| Enterprise | "What's your company size?" |
| Content/Media | "What genres do you like?" |
| Financial | Keep "annual income" — it's relevant |
| Marketplace / C2C | "Are you mostly buying or selling?" + follow-up category interest. Ask BOTH because the primary flow branches on this. |

Also update:
- `lastAssistantMsg.includes("annual income")` → check for the new question
- Welcome message: "Apply for any card" → "Shop" / "Start using" / appropriate verb
- Summary line: "💰 $income" → "✨ Interests: preferences"
- Avatar background color: `1A1F71` (Visa blue) → brand primary color

**`src/components/wwa-panel.tsx`** — BUY/CHECKOUT MESSAGES:

Replace credit-card phrasing in the buy intent responses:
- "apply for" → "order" / "shop" / "checkout"
- "card" → "product" / "item"
- "annual fee" → "price"
- "Quick apply" → "Quick checkout" / "Fast order"
- "I'll fill the form for you" → "I'll place the order for you"

**`src/components/world-map.tsx`** — REGIONAL STATS:

The template has credit-card network stats (`merchants: "12M+"`, `banks: "5,000+"`, `cards: "800M+"`). Replace with brand-appropriate stats:

| Brand Type | Regional Stats |
|------------|----------------|
| Luxury/Fashion | Boutiques per region, artisans, flagship locations |
| SaaS | Data centers, enterprise customers, API regions |
| Retail | Stores, distribution centers, warehouses |
| Finance | Banks, merchants, cards (keep default) |

Also update GLOBAL_STATS: `"4B+ Cards worldwide"` must match the brand's reality.

**`src/components/card-comparison.tsx`** — TIER BENEFITS:

The template has 20+ Visa-specific credit card benefits (Zero Liability, Auto Rental CDW, Trip Delay, Global Entry Credit, etc). REMOVE all of these and write tier benefits that apply to the brand:

| Brand Type | Tier Benefit Examples |
|------------|----------------------|
| Luxury/Fashion | Free shipping, gift wrap, personalization, private shopping, birthday gift, archive access |
| SaaS | API calls/mo, support SLA, seats, priority features, dedicated account manager |
| Retail | Free shipping threshold, returns window, early access, member pricing |
| Subscription | Streaming quality, devices, downloads, family sharing, ad-free |

Tier names `Traditional / Signature / Infinite` are Visa-specific — rename to match the brand's tier system (e.g., Free/Pro/Enterprise for SaaS, Essentials/Signature/Élite for luxury).

### Step 3.6: Verify Zero Original References

Three comprehensive checks. ALL must pass before deploying:

```bash
# 0. RE-RUN Step 2.3 visual verification for every image referenced from cards.ts / solutions.ts.
#    Open each file in Read and confirm it still shows the correct brand. Do not trust
#    earlier verification — if an agent rewrote data files during Phase 3, image paths may
#    have been shuffled. This check is fast (8-12 Read calls) and catches the #1 UX bug.
grep -oE '"/images/[^"]+"' src/lib/cards.ts src/lib/solutions.ts | sort -u
# For each path listed, Read it and confirm brand match.

# 1. Check for any Visa-brand text leaks
grep -rn "Visa\|visa\.\|#1A1F71\|#141963\|#1434CB" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v visaCards | grep -v VisaCard

# 2. Check for credit-card terminology that doesn't fit non-card brands
grep -rn "annual fee\|annual income\|card tier\|Apply Now\|cardholder\|APR\|Reward Rate\|Sign-Up Bonus\|issued by\|Zero Liability\|credit check\|credit history\|Traditional, Signature, and Infinite\|Issuer opt\." src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -i | grep -v node_modules
```

Fix every remaining line before deployment. The `card-3d.tsx` component is allowed to keep credit-card text because it's only rendered for actual credit card brands (Visa/Mastercard).

### Known template residues — scrub before deploy

These files ship in the template with Visa-shaped placeholders that the ordinary Phase 3 rewrites don't always catch. Verify each one explicitly before deploying:

| File | What to scrub |
|------|---------------|
| `src/components/book-demo-modal.tsx` | Ships with B2B fields (CompanySize, AnnualRevenue, Country dropdown, SKU picker) AND an inline Visa wordmark SVG in the header. For luxury / e-commerce brands, rewrite as "Request a Private Appointment" per the luxury pattern above. For SaaS keep B2B but relabel products. For consumer, replace entirely with a newsletter/contact form. **For marketplace / C2C brands**, rewrite as "Open your seller account" — fields: name + email + username + preferred market (dropdown of the brand's live markets only, NOT all countries) + account type (Personal vs Pro) + main category + expected item volume. Drop B2B revenue/size fields entirely. **For marketplace / Listings brands** (Booking, Airbnb, VRBO, Expedia), rewrite instead as "List your property" — fields: contact name + email + phone + property type (Hotel / Apartment / Villa / B&B / Holiday home / Cabin) + number of rooms + destination (city/country) + property name + short description + partner-terms opt-in. Primary audience of this modal is hosts, not buyers — the buyer surface is the search form in the hero. Drop B2B revenue/size fields. **For retail / multi-brand brands** (Sephora, Nordstrom, Net-A-Porter, Farfetch), rewrite as a loyalty signup — fields: name + email + birthday (short format MM-DD for anniversary gifts) + preferred categories (multi-select chips: Makeup / Skincare / Fragrance / Hair / Men / Gifts) + occasion dropdown ("For myself" / "As a gift" / "Wedding" / "Event") + GDPR/marketing consent checkbox. The loyalty programme name and tiers go in the header copy (e.g. Sephora's Blanche/Or/Noire, Nordstrom's Nordy Club). Drop B2B revenue/size fields. In all cases, replace the header SVG with `<img src={BRAND.logoImage} className="brightness-0 invert" />`. The hero's main CTA opens this modal — an untouched modal ships the wrong form and the wrong logo on the most-clicked button. |
| `src/lib/cards.ts` field repurposing per brand type | The `ProductItem` interface is finance-shaped (`issuer`/`tier`/`annualFee`/`apr`/`rewardRate`/`signUpBonus`/`applyUrl`) but the field names are stable — semantics repurpose per brand. Keep a comment block at top of `cards.ts` documenting the mapping so the next maintainer doesn't report them as Visa leaks. **Per brand type:** marketplace C2C → `annualFee: "Free" / "€5 shipping"`, `apr: "All markets"`, `rewardRate: headline benefit`, `signUpBonus: incentive`. Marketplace Listings → `annualFee: "from €180/night"`, `apr: "Entire place"`, `rewardRate: "★ 4.9"`, `signUpBonus: "Free cancellation"`. Retail Multi-brand Beauty → `issuer: brand name` (e.g. "Fenty Beauty"), `tier: collection/line`, `annualFee: price (€)`, `apr: shade / finish` ("50 shades · Matte finish"), `rewardRate: "★ 4.6 (1.2K reviews)"`, `signUpBonus: badge` ("Clean at Sephora" / "Award winner"), `applyUrl: product URL`. Luxury mono-brand → `issuer: House name`, `tier: line` (Lady Dior / Book Tote), `annualFee: price`, `apr: material/size`, `signUpBonus: included` (engraving / monogram). **Outerwear / Technical** → `issuer: **gender line**` ("Men's" / "Women's" / "Kids'" / "Unisex") — NOTE this is the inverse of beauty where `issuer` holds the brand name. For technical apparel the gender axis is the primary filter, so `issuer` carries it; the brand is implicit (mono-brand). `tier: collection` ("Expedition" / "Black Label" / "Lightweight"), `annualFee: price`, `apr: warmth rating / weight` ("TEI 4 · 2.05 kg"), `rewardRate: fill-power` ("625 fill"), `signUpBonus: sustainability badge` ("HUMANE DOWN" / "RECYCLED" / "MADE IN CANADA"). **Fashion editorial-minimalist / fast-fashion** → `issuer: gender line` ("Woman" / "Man" / "Kids" — same inversion as outerwear; mono-brand fashion uses issuer for gender, not brand). `tier: collection sub-line` ("Main" / "Studio" / "SRPLS" / "Origins" / "TRF" / "Limited Edition" / "Join Life"), `annualFee: price`, `apr: material/composition` ("100% linen" / "Wool blend"), `rewardRate: size range` ("XS – XXL"), `signUpBonus: badge` ("NEW" / "JOIN LIFE" / "LIMITED" / "BESTSELLER"). Also add `src/lib/collections.ts` for the parallel capsule sub-lines. Don't rename the interface properties unless you're willing to update ~12 component references. For listings marketplaces also create `src/lib/destinations.ts`; for multi-brand retail also create `src/lib/brands.ts` (brand catalogue) and optionally `src/lib/fragrances.ts` (notes + perfumer); for heritage + outerwear reuse the template's `src/lib/heritage.ts` + `src/lib/flagships.ts` stubs. |
| `src/components/assistant-shared.tsx` EmptyState | The welcome-screen logo is **the call button** (clicking it starts the voice call). Ships with an inline Visa wordmark SVG — which means the FIRST FRAME a customer sees before any interaction shows a Visa logo. Replace the `<svg><path d="..." /></svg>` inside the EmptyState button with `<img src={BRAND.logoImage} alt={BRAND.name} />`. Without this fix, every brand transform launches on a Visa logo. |
| `src/components/live-session-overlay.tsx` | Two inline SVG references render the Visa wordmark in the voice-call overlay (header + animated center). Replace with `<img src={BRAND.logoImage} alt={BRAND.name} />` or swap the SVG path — otherwise the voice call shows Visa. Also rewrite the system-prompt text (role, CTAs, "local banks in 200+ countries") per brand, BUT keep the "TOOL USE IS MANDATORY" block verbatim — it's what makes Gemini Live actually drive the left panel. |
| `src/lib/gemini-live-client.ts` | The `show_card` / `show_solution` tool descriptions include example IDs (`'chase-sapphire-preferred'`, `'tap-to-pay'`). Gemini Live reads these as strong hints about what valid IDs look like. If you leave them unchanged on a non-Visa brand, the voice call will refuse to invoke the tools or will call them with made-up IDs — and the left panel stays empty during the call. Replace both example IDs with real ids from your brand's `cards.ts` / `solutions.ts` (e.g. `'jadore-edp'`, `'cruise-2026'`). This is the single most common reason voice calls "just talk" without updating the visible panel. |
| `src/components/agent-panel.tsx` | The mock API key uses the prefix `vsk_live_` (Visa-derived). Change to a brand-neutral `api_live_` or a brand-specific prefix (`hsk_`, `drk_`, etc). Runs through `Math.random().toString(36)` — easy to miss. |
| `src/lib/cards.ts` | The `ProductItem` interface fields (`annualFee`, `apr`, `rewardRate`, `signUpBonus`, `issuer`, `applyUrl`) all bias toward credit cards. For non-card brands, either repurpose them (document with a comment block at the top of cards.ts — e.g. `annualFee` → price, `apr` → material, `rewardRate` → craftsmanship) or rename the interface properly (updates ~12 components). The audit grep cannot tell a repurposed field from a leak. |
| `src/components/hero-section.tsx` | Often still contains hardcoded `STATS` / `CARD_TIERS` arrays instead of reading from `BRAND.stats`. Replace with `BRAND.stats.map(...)` so stats come from brand-config. |
| `src/components/inner-page.tsx` | Contains `PersonalPage`, `BusinessPage`, `TravelPage` route shapes that assume a payments-brand nav. Rename / re-shape to match `BRAND.navItems` or delete and let `page.tsx` route dynamically. |

## PHASE 4: Build, Deploy, Verify

### Step 4.0: Generate a unique, safe slug (REQUIRED)

**Every transform MUST deploy under a `project-*` slug, not the raw brand name.** Two reasons:

1. **Safe Browsing safety** — Chrome's brand-phishing classifier flags any subdomain that looks like a well-known brand (`booking.codiris.app`, `apple.codiris.app`, `nike.codiris.app`). Using `project-<brand>-<unique>` breaks that exact-match heuristic. This is a hard requirement for new transforms since the Booking incident (2026-04-21).
2. **Collision avoidance** — multiple customers transforming the same brand would race for one subdomain. A unique suffix guarantees every customer's deploy has its own URL.

**The required slug shape:**

```
project-<short-brand>-<4char-hex>
```

- `<short-brand>` — 3-8 letters, lowercase, pointing at the brand but not the full domain. Drop the word most associated with the real brand if the full name is too recognizable. Examples:
  - `booking.com` → `book24` (NOT `booking`)
  - `airbnb.com` → `abnb`
  - `dior.com` → `dior` is fine (not a phishing target yet)
  - `nike.com` → `nk` or `nike` (borderline — prefer `nk`)
  - `chase.com` → `chs` (fintech = high-risk — always obfuscate)
- `<4char-hex>` — generated from `openssl rand -hex 2` (4 hex chars = 65,536 combinations). Never reuse.

**Generate at the start of Phase 4:**

```bash
SHORT_BRAND="book24"     # replace per brand
RANDOM_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 2)
SLUG="project-${SHORT_BRAND}-${RANDOM_ID}"
echo "Your slug: $SLUG"
# e.g. project-book24-a4f2
```

Save this value — you'll use it in `brand-config.ts`, as the Vercel project name, as the Cloudflare CNAME, and as the alias.

**Collision check against the registry:**

```bash
curl -s -o /tmp/claim.json -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://codiris.app/api/wwa/registry/$SLUG"
```

- **HTTP 404** — slug is free (expected when using the 4-char random suffix). Continue.
- **HTTP 200** — astronomically unlikely collision. Regenerate `RANDOM_ID` and try again.

**Update brand-config.ts** so every runtime reference to the deploy URL is correct:

```ts
export const BRAND: BrandConfig = {
  // ...
  mcpUrl: `https://wwa.${SLUG}.codiris.app/mcp`,   // replace ${SLUG} with your generated value
  mcpServerName: `${SLUG}-agent`,                   // used in MCP server name + CLI install command
};
```

**Exceptions (grandfathered):** the original 7 brands on `codiris.app/skills` (visa, stripe, dior, ralphlauren, hermes, puma, vinted) still live at `wwa.<brand>.codiris.app` — they pre-date this policy. Do NOT add new transforms at raw-brand subdomains; every new one gets a `project-*` slug.

**After a successful deploy,** open a PR to `public/wwa-registry.json` in `wwwtowwa` adding your entry:

```json
{
  "slug": "{short-brand}",
  "domain": "{brand}.com",
  "deployed_url": "https://wwa.{slug-with-random}.codiris.app",
  "mcp_url": "https://wwa.{slug-with-random}.codiris.app/mcp",
  "type": "{luxury-french|luxury-heritage|fintech|saas|marketplace|marketplace-listings|sportswear|consumer}",
  "color": "{brand primary hex}",
  "first_claimed_at": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "owner": "{your-handle-or-email}"
}
```

Note: the registry `slug` field is the **short brand** (e.g. `booking`) so the showcase lookup groups all deploys of that brand together, while `deployed_url` carries the full `project-<brand>-<hex>` subdomain that's unique per transform.

### Step 4.1: Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Fix ALL errors. Common: unterminated strings, missing images, type mismatches.

### Step 4.2: Deploy

Create `.env.local` in your new project with the keys below. A stub `.env.example` ships in the template — `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill in your own values.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…          # from https://platform.openai.com (fallback chat model)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza…         # from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey (primary)
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIza…  # same value as GEMINI_API_KEY (the voice client reads this name)
```

The MCP endpoint renders without these keys — only the AI chat + voice call need them.

```bash
npx vercel --prod --yes

# Push env vars to Vercel
source .env.local
echo "$OPENAI_API_KEY"               | npx vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY               production --force
echo "$GEMINI_API_KEY"               | npx vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY               production --force
echo "$GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY" | npx vercel env add GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY production --force

npx vercel --prod --yes
```

### Step 4.2b: Disable Vercel Deployment Protection (if the deploy returns 401)

New Vercel projects under some team accounts default to **Standard Protection** (SSO-required). Symptom: `curl https://wwa{brand}.vercel.app` returns **HTTP 401** with a Vercel SSO login page. Happens silently — no warning from the CLI.

Check with `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://{your-vercel-url}`. If you see 401, disable protection via the Vercel API:

```bash
# Read the Vercel CLI's auth token (macOS path)
TOKEN=$(cat "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.vercel.cli/auth.json" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get("token",""))')
PROJECT_ID=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('.vercel/project.json'))['projectId'])")
TEAM_ID=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('.vercel/project.json'))['orgId'])")

curl -s -X PATCH "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/$PROJECT_ID?teamId=$TEAM_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ssoProtection":null,"passwordProtection":null}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; r=json.load(sys.stdin); print('sso:', r.get('ssoProtection'), '| pw:', r.get('passwordProtection'))"
```

Expected output: `sso: None | pw: None`. The change takes effect within seconds — no redeploy needed.

Linux path: `$HOME/.local/share/com.vercel.cli/auth.json`. Windows path: `%APPDATA%\com.vercel.cli\auth.json`.

### Step 4.3: Custom subdomain (OPTIONAL — requires Cloudflare token)

The `wwa.{brand}.codiris.app` alias requires a Cloudflare API token scoped to the `codiris.app` zone. **This token is not shipped with the skill** — it's private infrastructure. Two paths:

**A. You have the token** (maintainer, or coordinated with Iris Lab):
```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=…  # scoped to codiris.app zone, DNS edit permission

ZONE_ID=$(curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?name=codiris.app" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['result'][0]['id'])")
curl -s -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dns_records" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"CNAME","name":"wwa.{domain}","content":"cname.vercel-dns.com","proxied":false,"ttl":1}'
npx vercel domains add wwa.{domain}.codiris.app
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

**B. You don't have the token** (most customers):
Skip this step. Your Vercel default URL (`https://<project>.vercel.app`) is a fully working agentfront — the MCP endpoint, chat, and all pages work there. Update `brand-config.ts` `mcpUrl` to the Vercel URL so the displayed install command matches. Ask the registry owner (open an issue at github.com/Humiris/wwa-transform) to provision the `wwa.{brand}.codiris.app` alias when you're ready to ship under the shared subdomain.

### Step 4.4: Verify
1. Check HTTP 200: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://wwa.{domain}.codiris.app`
2. Use WebFetch to read the deployed page — check NO wrong-company content
3. Check images load
4. **MCP round-trip**: `curl -s -m 20 -X POST https://wwa.{domain}.codiris.app/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'` — must return the tool list with 200
5. Report URL to user

**Preview-tool caveat:** the `preview_start` MCP tool detects `package.json` from your **session cwd**, not from `.claude/launch.json` in the target project. If your session cwd is not the target project (e.g. you're working on `wwa.ralphlauren` from a session rooted at `wwa.visa`), `preview_start` will start the wrong dev server. Verify via `curl` against the deployed URL instead of local screenshots when working cross-project.
