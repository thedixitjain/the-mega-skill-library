# superloopy-doctor

SUPERLOOPY DOCTOR ENABLED

Use this skill to prove whether a local Superloopy surface can support the Superloopy loop: repo-local `.superloopy/` state, artifact-backed evidence under `.superloopy/evidence/`, bundled crew agents, hook steering, and the deterministic completion floor. It is read-only by default. Do not mutate plugin config, wrappers, agents, caches, or source files unless the user explicitly asks for repair after seeing the report.

## Native Boundary

This is a Superloopy health check, not a generic plugin drift audit.

- Treat `superloopy doctor --scope source --json` as the source-checkout truth surface and `superloopy doctor --scope installed --json` as the machine-local installation truth surface. The JSON `scope` field records which verdict contract was used.
- Treat loop commands as the behavioral truth surface, but keep their limits clear: `superloopy loop status --json`, `superloopy loop check`, `superloopy loop guide --json`, and evidence files under `.superloopy/evidence/` can show current plan and artifact readiness.
- Read the installed plugin cache only to identify which Superloopy code the wrapper runs.
- Do not clone external repos, search issue trackers, or compare unrelated harness layouts unless the user separately asks for research.
- `superloopy doctor` reports the plugin root it checked: by default it uses `source` scope in a recognized Superloopy checkout and `installed` scope elsewhere. Pin a checkout with `superloopy doctor --root <checkout> --scope source --json`; pin an installed cache with `superloopy doctor --root <cache> --scope installed --json`. Source verdicts still return machine-local diagnostics, but `installedModelPolicy` and `wrapper` do not gate source health.

## Installed-plugin Authority

`installedPluginTruth` runs the read-only `codex plugin list --json` authority probe for `superloopy@beefiker`; it never infers the installed version from cache directory names. A confirmed version mismatch is informational in source scope, but fails installed scope. Missing Codex, no registered plugin, and invalid authority output are informational and do not fail doctor. Report these four states as `current`, `version_mismatch`, `not_registered`, or `authority_unavailable`; never repair from this probe without explicit approval.

## Diagnostic Spine

1. Identify the target root: `pwd`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` when it is a checkout, and the installed plugin cache path when the wrapper points into one.
2. Locate the user-visible command: `command -v superloopy`, `which -a superloopy`, and the wrapper text or symlink target.
3. Inspect Codex registry state with `codex plugin list --json` when Codex is available; use it only to locate `superloopy@beefiker` and its version.
4. Run the matching scoped command and record the reported `scope` and `root`. For checkout health use `superloopy doctor --root <checkout> --scope source --json`; for a machine-local wrapper, managed-agent fleet, or installed cache use `superloopy doctor --root <cache> --scope installed --json`.
5. Read the named doctor checks, especially `skills`, `fileAudit`, `reviewability`, `dispatchCoherence`, `hostContract`, `modelPolicy`, and `claudeHostWiring`.
6. Probe loop readiness without changing state: use `superloopy loop status --json` if a plan exists, otherwise note "no active plan" instead of creating one. Use `superloopy loop check` only to validate trace/artifact readiness for an existing plan; read-only diagnosis cannot prove completion safety because it does not re-run recorded commands. If the user asks whether completion is actually safe, point at the real gates: `superloopy loop review`, `superloopy loop checkpoint`, or `superloopy loop finish`.
7. Verify crew install shape by name: `franky`, `zoro`, `usopp`, `jinbe`, `robin`, and `nami`; judge by files and doctor checks, not by role labels alone.
8. If managed state is absent, distinguish no fleet from an exact hash-known legacy fleet and an unmanaged/edited conflict. Exact legacy fleets can migrate without `--force`; never infer ownership from names alone.
9. Compare the generated wrapper target with the diagnosed plugin root and report a split-brain warning when they differ.
10. Report configured model routing as `model_unverified` unless the host attests both the resolved role and model.
11. Report PASS, WARN, or FAIL with command output, file path, or JSON check evidence.

## Verdict Rules

- `PASS`: wrapper/cache/checkout, `superloopy doctor --json`, and relevant loop/evidence surfaces agree within read-only limits.
- `WARN`: Superloopy can run, but a wrapper points at an older cache, no active plan exists for loop readiness, read-only mode cannot prove completion safety, host behavior is advisory only, or manual evidence cannot be command-replayed.
- `FAIL`: doctor named checks fail, wrapper is absent or points at the wrong root, required agents are missing, `.superloopy/` state is corrupt, or the deterministic completion floor cannot be evaluated.

## Repair Guidance

Recommend repair commands only after the read-only report explains the failure:

- Marketplace refresh: `codex plugin marketplace upgrade beefiker`.
- Confirmed `installedPluginTruth` mismatch after approval: `codex plugin add superloopy@beefiker --json`, then start a new Codex session.
- Checkout install: `node src/cli.js install --json`.
- Forced local wrapper/agent overwrite: `node src/cli.js install --force --json`.

Never run `install --force`, plugin remove, marketplace remove, cache deletion, or wrapper deletion without explicit user approval.

## Report Format

```text
Superloopy doctor report
Summary: <healthy/degraded/broken in one sentence>

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command wrapper | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <path, target, cache or checkout root> |
| Doctor checks | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <ok=true or failing check names> |
| Evidence floor | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <.superloopy/evidence/, loop check/status readiness, or "completion safety requires the real gate"> |
| Crew install | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <agent files and dispatchCoherence evidence> |
| Host limits | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <hostContract/claudeHostWiring evidence> |
| Reviewability/native boundary | PASS/WARN/FAIL | <reviewability/fileAudit/designAudit evidence> |

Recommended repair:
- <exact command or "none">
```

## Hard Rules

- Read-only by default.
- Diagnose Superloopy's own contract: package, hooks, skills, CLI, dependency-free boundary, runtime ignore policy, file inventory, design audit, dispatch coherence, model policy, host contract, reviewability, and deterministic completion floor.
- Treat stale wrappers and stale installed plugin caches as separate findings; a marketplace refresh alone is not proof.
- Do not claim a marketplace upgrade fixed anything until the wrapper and `superloopy doctor --json` prove it.
- Do not mark a loop completion-safe from status or `superloopy loop check` alone; those are read-only readiness signals. Completion safety requires the real gate path (`superloopy loop review`, `superloopy loop checkpoint`, or `superloopy loop finish`) because those gates re-derive command-backed criteria.
- If terminal capability noise affects host commands, rerun with a normal terminal environment before recording a failure.
