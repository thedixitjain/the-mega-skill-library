# Team Formation: Sizing and Roles

Rules for forming agent teams based on mission complexity.

## Purpose

Team Formation ensures the right team size and roles for
coordinated agent work. Too few agents underutilize parallelism;
too many create coordination overhead. Clear roles prevent
confusion and ensure accountability.

## When to Use

Apply Team Formation rules when:

- Planning a multi-agent mission (more than one agent needed)
- Deciding between single-session, subagents, or agent-team mode
- Sizing a team for a complex, multi-file change
- Determining whether a Reviewer role is needed

Do NOT apply when:

- The task fits in a single session with one agent
- Work is trivial and doesn't need parallelism
- You're just running a quick one-off command

## Getting Started

1. Assess mission complexity (simple/moderate/complex/critical)
2. Determine execution mode (single-session/subagents/agent-team)
3. Apply sizing rules from the tables below
4. Assign Coordinator role to main session
5. Assign Agent roles to task executors
6. Add Reviewer role if Level 2+ (Elevated/Critical)
7. Define file ownership to prevent conflicts

## Why This Pattern

The 10-agent maximum isn't arbitrary. Coordination overhead grows
quadratically: n agents create n(n-1)/2 communication channels.
At 10 agents, you have 45 potential paths. Beyond that, the cost
of coordination exceeds the benefit of parallelism.

Clear roles prevent the "everyone owns everything" problem where
no one is accountable. The Coordinator owns the mission outcome;
Agents own their tasks; Reviewers own quality validation.

This pattern emerged from observing that teams with explicit
roles complete missions faster than teams where everyone tries
to do everything.

## Role Definitions

### Coordinator (Always 1)

**Responsibility**: Mission coordination and final synthesis

**Duties**:

- Receives mission charter and forms the team
- Delegates tasks to agents
- Resolves blockers and conflicts
- Monitors budget and progress
- Produces final mission report

**Selection criteria**:

- Strong context awareness
- Good at summarization and synthesis
- Can make trade-off decisions

### Agent (2-7)

**Responsibility**: Own individual tasks and deliverables

**Duties**:

- Execute assigned tasks independently
- Report progress and blockers to coordinator
- Validate own work before marking complete
- Coordinate with other agents on shared interfaces

**Selection criteria**:

- Domain expertise relevant to task
- Self-directed execution capability
- Clear communication

### Reviewer (0-1)

**Responsibility**: Adversarial review and challenge

**Duties**:

- Challenge assumptions in plans
- Validate outputs against requirements
- Check rollback readiness
- Provide "what could go wrong" perspective

**When included**:

- Medium to high risk missions (Level 2+)
- Complex multi-component changes
- Security or compliance sensitive work

**Selection criteria**:

- Different perspective from task agents
- Critical thinking skills
- Can be adversarial constructively

## Team Sizing Rules

### Simple Mission

```yaml
complexity: simple
mode: single-session
team_size: 1
roles:
  - 1 Coordinator (Claude works solo)
includes_reviewer: false
example: "Fix a bug in a single function"
```

### Moderate Mission

```yaml
complexity: moderate
mode: subagents
team_size: 2-4
roles:
  - 1 Coordinator (main session)
  - 1-3 Agents (task executors)
includes_reviewer: false
example: "Add a new feature with tests across 2-3 files"
```

### Complex Mission

```yaml
complexity: complex
mode: subagents
team_size: 5-7
roles:
  - 1 Coordinator (main session)
  - 4-6 Agents (task executors)
includes_reviewer: true
example: "Refactor authentication across API, frontend, and database"
```

### Critical Mission

```yaml
complexity: critical
mode: agent-team
team_size: 5-10
roles:
  - 1 Coordinator (main session)
  - 4-8 Agents (task executors)
  - 1 Reviewer (challenger)
includes_reviewer: true
example: "Migrate payment system from Stripe v2 to v3"
```

## Maximum Team Size

**Hard limit**: 10 agents total

**Rationale**:

- Coordination overhead grows quadratically with team size
- Communication channels = n(n-1)/2
- At 10 agents: 45 potential communication paths
- Beyond 10: consider splitting into separate missions

## Team Formation Checklist

Before dispatching a team:

- [ ] Mission complexity assessed (simple/moderate/complex/critical)
- [ ] Team size determined using rules above
- [ ] Coordinator designated (main session or lead agent)
- [ ] Agents assigned to tasks
- [ ] Reviewer included if Level 2+
- [ ] File ownership defined (no overlapping writes)
- [ ] Communication protocol established (report to coordinator)

## File Ownership Rules

To prevent conflicts, each file should have exactly one agent
responsible for writes:

```
# GOOD: Clear ownership
Agent A: src/api/auth.py, tests/api/test_auth.py
Agent B: src/api/users.py, tests/api/test_users.py

# BAD: Overlapping ownership
Agent A: src/api/auth.py
Agent B: src/api/auth.py  # Conflict!
```

If multiple agents need to modify the same file:

1. Serialize the modifications (Agent A goes first, then B)
2. Or use git worktrees for isolation
3. Or combine into a single agent's scope

## Example Team Formations

### Example 1: API Refactor (Moderate)

```
Mission: Refactor API error handling for consistency

Team:
  Coordinator: Main Claude session
  Agent 1: src/api/errors.py, tests/api/test_errors.py
  Agent 2: src/api/handlers/, tests/api/test_handlers.py
  Reviewer: Not included (Level 1)

Mode: subagents
Team size: 3
```

### Example 2: Auth Migration (Complex)

```
Mission: Migrate from session-based to JWT authentication

Team:
  Coordinator: Main Claude session
  Agent 1: src/auth/jwt.py, tests/auth/
  Agent 2: src/api/middleware/, src/api/decorators/
  Agent 3: Frontend auth integration
  Agent 4: Database token storage
  Reviewer: Agent for security review

Mode: subagents
Team size: 6
```

### Example 3: Payment System (Critical)

```
Mission: Migrate payment processing from Stripe v2 to v3

Team:
  Coordinator: Main Claude session
  Agent 1: src/payments/stripe_v3.py
  Agent 2: src/api/webhooks/, tests/webhooks/
  Agent 3: Database migration scripts
  Agent 4: Frontend payment forms
  Agent 5: Monitoring and alerting
  Reviewer: Agent for edge case testing

Mode: agent-team (experimental)
Team size: 7
```

## Integration with Execution Modes

| Mode | Team Size | Reviewer | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| single-session | 1 | Never | Simple, sequential tasks |
| subagents | 2-7 | Optional | Parallel independent tasks |
| agent-team | 5-10 | Required | Complex coordinated work |

See `../../delegation-core/references/execution-modes.md` for mode selection guidance.
