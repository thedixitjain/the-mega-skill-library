# Theory & Argument Building (io-theory-building)

IO publishes "articles that propose **generalizable theories**" of international politics. A result is
not an IO contribution until it is attached to an **IR theory the field can carry to other cases,
dyads, and institutions.** This skill turns findings into theory: explicit mechanisms operating at or
across the international level, scope conditions, and observable implications.

## When to trigger

- The empirics are strong but the "so what for IR theory" is thin
- A reviewer said the paper is "atheoretical," "ad hoc," or "just a finding"
- You need to state the international mechanism, assumptions, and scope conditions explicitly
- Formal modeling: deciding what to model about strategic interaction among states/actors

## Build the argument (by mode of work)

### Empirical paper with an IR theory
1. **Concept** — define the key IR construct precisely (e.g., institutional legitimacy, audience cost,
   credible commitment); distinguish it from neighbors.
2. **International mechanism** — the causal story at/across the international level: which actors
   (states, IGOs, firms, transnational groups), what strategic incentives and constraints, why.
3. **Observable implications** — what we should see if the mechanism operates internationally (and what
   we should *not* see). These become the tests in `io-research-design`.
4. **Scope conditions** — which regimes, issue areas, or structural conditions the argument holds under.
   Portability ≠ universality.

### Formal / game-theoretic paper (a core IO mode)
- State the **substantive IR puzzle** (bargaining failure, cooperation under anarchy, delegation,
  signaling) before the setup.
- Keep assumptions **transparent and motivated**; flag which equilibria are robust to which assumptions.
- Translate equilibrium predictions into **comparative statics** a reader can test or recognize in
  international politics.
- Note: IO **verifies proofs of formal models before final acceptance** — write proofs to be checked
  (complete, in an appendix), not gestured at.

### Constructivist / ideational / interpretive paper
- Make the **conceptual stakes** explicit — norms, identities, legitimacy, social meaning in world
  politics — and connect them to behavior.
- Build the argument through reasons, discourse, and evidence; engage the **rationalist baseline** it
  improves on and state what each would and would not expect to observe.

## The "portability" test (IO-specific)

Ask: *Could an IR scholar import this mechanism to a different issue area, dyad, or institution?* If
yes, you have a generalizable IR theory. If it only works for your one case/IGO, generalize the logic
or reframe (back to `io-topic-selection`).

## Worked theory vignette (illustrative): finding to portable theory

Start with a bare finding: states joining an international monitoring institution show higher later
compliance. As stated it is not yet an IO contribution — it could be selection and names no general
mechanism. To build it into a theory: define the **construct** (*credible commitment via delegated
monitoring*); state the **cross-border mechanism** — monitoring makes violations common knowledge across
the membership, so states anticipating future cooperation gains internalize the reputational cost, a logic
running through the institution, not any domestic process;
derive **observable implications** (gains concentrate where monitoring is informative, *absent* where
conduct is unobservable); bound it with **scope conditions** (verifiable conduct, repeated interaction);
and check **portability** — the logic travels to arms control, trade dispute settlement, or environmental
regimes, clearing IO's broad-significance bar.

## Theory-strength rubric (how an IO referee grades the argument)

| Grade | Argument looks like… | Typical referee line |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Strong | portable mechanism + scope conditions + clear non-implications | "a generalizable theory of world politics" |
| Borderline | a mechanism named but tied to one institution | "promising but narrow — does it travel?" |
| Weak | a finding with hypotheses attached post hoc | "atheoretical / ad hoc" |

IO's theory premium means a Borderline argument with flawless empirics still often draws an R&R aimed at
the theory, not the data.

## Anti-patterns

- A domestic-politics mechanism relabeled as IR — the action must be international or cross-border
- "Hypothesizing after results are known" (HARKing); preregister where possible
- A formal model with opaque assumptions tuned to the desired equilibrium, or proofs left incomplete
- Mechanisms named but never made observable at the international level
- Universal claims with no scope conditions; a finding with no theory the field can reuse
- A mechanism that travels nowhere beyond the studied institution (fails the broad-significance bar)

## Output format

```
【Core IR claim】one sentence
【International mechanism】the causal/strategic story (who, why, under what constraints)
【Assumptions】(formal) the load-bearing ones; proof appendix planned?
【Observable implications】testable consequences → research-design
【Scope conditions】issue areas / regimes where it holds / fails
【Portability】who else in IR can use this theory
【Next】io-research-design
```
