# Discovery Skill

## Invocation Modes

Two modes of operation:

- **Standalone** (`/discovery [scope]`): Full 6-phase flow with interactive triage (Phases 0-6)
- **Embedded** (from session-end when `discovery-on-close: true`): Phases 0-4 only, returns structured findings to session-end

<!-- scope-enum SSOT (#762): this line is the canonical token list; the wiring test derives SCOPE_TOKENS from it. Add/remove tokens HERE first, the test guards the other surfaces. -->
The `scope` argument accepts: `all` (default), `code`, `infra`, `ui`, `arch`, `session`, `audit`, `vault`, `feature`, or comma-separated like `code,session`.

## Phase 0: Bootstrap Gate

Read `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` and execute the gate check. If the gate is CLOSED, invoke `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` and wait for completion before proceeding. If the gate is OPEN, continue to Phase 1.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed past Phase 0 if GATE_CLOSED. There is no bypass. Refer to `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` for the full HARD-GATE constraints.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase 1: Read Session Config

Read and parse Session Config per `skills/_shared/config-reading.md`. Store result as `$CONFIG`.

Discovery-relevant fields (parse these specifically):
- `discovery-on-close`, `discovery-probes`, `discovery-exclude-paths`, `discovery-severity-threshold`, `discovery-confidence-threshold`, `discovery-parallelism`
- `test-command`, `typecheck-command`, `lint-command`
- `pencil`, `vcs`, `cross-repos`, `stale-issue-days`

## Phase 2: Stack Detection & Probe Activation

Detect the project's tech stack via marker file checks. Use Glob and run checks in parallel:

| Marker File(s)                        | Activates               |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `package.json`                        | JS/TS probes            |
| `tsconfig.json`                       | TypeScript probes       |
| `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` | Python probes           |
| `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml`   | Container probes        |
| `vercel.json` / `.vercel/`            | Vercel probes           |
| `.github/workflows/`                  | GitHub CI probes        |
| `.gitlab-ci.yml`                      | GitLab CI probes        |
| `supabase/`                           | Supabase probes         |
| `next.config.*` / `nuxt.config.*`     | SSR probes              |
| `tailwind.config.*`                   | Tailwind probes         |
| Pencil in Session Config              | design-drift probe      |
| `.orchestrator/bootstrap.lock`        | harness-audit probe     |
| `.vault.yaml` OR Session Config `vault-integration.enabled: true` | vault probes      |
| `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `Cargo.toml` **AND** Session Config `slopcheck.enabled: true` AND `slopcheck.sources` includes `"discovery"` | supply-chain probe (`skills/discovery/probes-supply-chain.md`) |
| `docs/` directory present **AND** Session Config `docs-staleness.enabled: true` | docs-staleness probe (`skills/discovery/probes-docs.md`) |
| `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md` on Codex CLI) or `README.md` present in repo root | ssot-code-diff probe (`skills/discovery/probes-docs.md`) — always active within the docs category, no Session Config gate |

### Build Activation Set

1. Start with all probes whose marker files are present
2. If `discovery-probes` is set in config, intersect with that list
3. If a `scope` argument was passed, restrict to that category
4. Remove probes whose activation conditions are not met

The audit probe activates when `bootstrap.lock` is present OR when `discovery-probes` config explicitly lists `audit`.

The vault probe activates when `.vault.yaml` is present in the repo root OR when `vault-integration.enabled: true` in Session Config OR when `discovery-probes` config explicitly lists `vault`.

The feature probe activates ONLY when the scope argument includes `feature` OR when `discovery-probes` config explicitly lists `feature`. It never activates under bare `all` — feature discovery is an explicitly requested scan, and its interactive router (below) cannot run in embedded mode.

### Exclude Paths

Default exclude paths (always apply):
- `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `coverage/`

Add any paths from `discovery-exclude-paths` in Session Config.

### VCS Detection

> **VCS Reference:** Detect the VCS platform per the "VCS Auto-Detection" section of the gitlab-ops skill.

### Status Report

Report: "Discovery: [N] probes active across [categories]. Stack: [detected]. Threshold: [severity]."

### Feature-Scope Router (standalone only)

Fires ONLY when the active scope set includes `feature` AND the skill is running standalone (coordinator context). In embedded mode (session-end dispatches discovery as an Explore subagent — AskUserQuestion is unavailable in subagents per `.claude/rules/ask-via-tool.md` AUQ-004), the router MUST NOT fire; proceed directly with the grounded scan as the non-interactive default.

Judgment-based PM work (opportunity framing, personas, market-sizing) deliberately stays OUT of the verified-findings pipeline (Epic #750) — this router is the fork point that keeps grounded, evidence-anchored discovery separate from open-ended product judgment.

When the gate above is satisfied, present exactly this AskUserQuestion (AUQ-003 shape) before proceeding to Phase 3:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Scope `feature` was requested. How should this run handle feature discovery?",
    header: "Feature Scope",
    options: [
      { label: "Grounded scan (Recommended)", description: "Run the evidence-anchored feature probes (intent-drift, stubbed-dead-feature) on the probe→verify→triage rails." },
      { label: "Also judgment topics", description: "Grounded scan PLUS collect judgment-based product questions (opportunity framing, personas). A follow-up prompt after Phase 5 offers inline synthesis or hand-off to /brainstorm or /plan feature — judgment items never enter the verified-findings pipeline." },
      { label: "Route out", description: "No scan; hand off to /brainstorm (product ideation) or /grill (assumption stress-test) instead." },
      { label: "Skip", description: "Drop `feature` from this run's scope set." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

**On user selection (every branch is explicit — do not fall through):**

- **"Grounded scan"** → keep `feature` in the active scope set and continue to Phase 3 unchanged.
- **"Also judgment topics"** → keep `feature` in the active scope set and continue to Phase 3 unchanged for the grounded probes. Collect any judgment-based product questions (opportunity framing, personas, market-sizing) encountered during the scan as plain notes — do not route them through Phase 4 (Verification) or Phase 6 (Issue-Creation) at any point. AFTER Phase 5 triage completes, present a SECOND AskUserQuestion that forks how the collected topics are handled:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Judgment topics were collected alongside the grounded scan. How should they be handled?",
    header: "Judgment Topics",
    options: [
      { label: "Inline synthesis (Recommended)", description: "Sketch a lightweight OST/persona pass directly in the report's `### Judgment Topics (non-verified)` appendix — explicitly marked non-verified, no separate skill invocation needed." },
      { label: "Route to /brainstorm", description: "Hand the collected topics off as pre-filled context to /brainstorm for a full Socratic ideation dialogue." },
      { label: "Route to /plan feature", description: "Hand the collected topics off as pre-filled context to /plan feature for feature-PRD scoping." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

  - **"Inline synthesis"** → append a `### Judgment Topics (non-verified)` section to the discovery report. For each collected topic, write a brief candidate outcome/opportunity sketch (Teresa Torres OST framing) and, where a persona angle is evident, a one-line persona note — every line explicitly labeled `(non-verified sketch)`. This is prose synthesis, never a probe finding.
  - **"Route to /brainstorm"** → append the same `### Judgment Topics (non-verified)` section, but render each topic as a one-line pointer plus the recommendation to invoke `/brainstorm` with the collected topic context pre-filled as its initial prompt. Do not auto-invoke `/brainstorm` — surface the recommendation and let the operator trigger it.
  - **"Route to /plan feature"** → same rendering as the `/brainstorm` branch above, pointing at `/plan feature` with the collected topic context pre-filled instead.

  **Invariant (PRD §4 Non-Goals) — holds across all three sub-branches above:** judgment items are report-appendix ONLY — they MUST NOT become findings, MUST NOT pass through Phase 4 verification, and MUST NOT produce issues in Phase 6.
- **"Route out"** → remove `feature` from the active scope set. Do NOT run the feature probes. Recommend the operator invoke `/brainstorm` or `/grill` after this run (name whichever fits the operator's question), then continue to Phase 3 with the remaining scopes — or, if `feature` was the ONLY requested scope, stop after reporting: "Feature scope routed out — no probes to run. Invoke /brainstorm or /grill directly."
- **"Skip"** → remove `feature` from the active scope set before Phase 3. If `feature` was the only requested scope, stop with: "Feature scope skipped — nothing to run."

## Phase 3: Probe Execution

### --since Filtering (when `since_ref` is provided)

When `since_ref` is set (passed from the `/discovery --since <git-ref>` invocation):

1. Call `changedFilesSince(since_ref)` from `scripts/lib/discovery/helpers.mjs`.
2. If the helper throws (ref unresolvable), surface the error to the user and halt.
3. If the result is `[]` (no files changed since the ref), emit:
   ```
   No files changed since <since_ref>. Skipping discovery.
   ```
   and exit with status 0. Do NOT fall back to a full-repo scan.
4. If the result is a non-empty array, pass it as `changedFiles` context to each probe agent below.

**Probe exemptions:** The vault-staleness probe and the harness-audit probe are EXEMPT from `--since` filtering — they always scan the full repository because their analysis targets metadata (vault narrative staleness, bootstrap lock state) that is not file-diff-gated. This exemption is advisory: no code enforcement is applied in this wave. The probe agents will naturally read whole-repo state; the `changedFiles` context they receive from `--since` is informational and does not restrict their glob/grep scope.

Dispatch probe agents IN PARALLEL using the Agent tool. Group by category (max `$CONFIG['discovery-parallelism']` agents, default 5):

> **Cursor IDE:** No Agent() tool available. Run probes sequentially within the current session — one category at a time. Complete each category's analysis before moving to the next.

- **Code probes agent**: Runs all activated code probes (hardcoded-values, orphaned-annotations, dead-code, ai-slop, type-safety-gaps, test-coverage-gaps, test-anti-patterns, security-basics)
- **Infra probes agent**: Runs all activated infra probes
- **UI probes agent**: Runs all activated UI probes
- **Arch probes agent**: Runs all activated arch probes
- **Session probes agent**: Runs all activated session probes
- **Audit probes agent**: Runs harness-audit probe
- **Vault probes** (`skills/discovery/probes-vault.md`): invokes `skills/discovery/probes/vault-staleness.mjs` and `skills/discovery/probes/vault-narrative-staleness.mjs` directly via `node`. Each probe returns `{findings, metrics, duration_ms}`. The runner reports `FINDING:` blocks per finding and appends summary records to `.orchestrator/metrics/vault-staleness.jsonl` and `vault-narrative-staleness.jsonl`.
- **Supply-chain probe** (`skills/discovery/probes-supply-chain.md`): invokes `skills/discovery/probes/supply-chain-slopcheck.mjs` directly via `node`. **Gated:** only activates when `slopcheck.enabled: true` AND `"discovery"` is in `slopcheck.sources` (Session Config). The probe returns `{findings, summary}`. SLOP findings surface as `critical`, ASSUMED as `medium`, LEGITIMATE packages generate no finding. See `probes-supply-chain.md` for invocation details and classification reference.
- **Docs probe** (`skills/discovery/probes-docs.md`): invokes `skills/discovery/probes/docs-staleness.mjs` AND `skills/discovery/probes/ssot-code-diff.mjs` directly via `node`. `docs-staleness.mjs` is **gated:** only activates when a `docs/` directory exists AND `docs-staleness.enabled: true` (Session Config); it scans `docs/*.md` (root level) and `docs/examples/*.md` for filesystem-mtime staleness against the `docs-staleness.thresholds.living` threshold (default 90d) — `docs/adr/` and `docs/prd/` are deliberately excluded. `ssot-code-diff.mjs` is **ungated** (no Session Config key) — it always runs when `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` is present, diffing hardcoded doc "count" claims (e.g. "(13 rules)") against the live code/filesystem value they describe. Both probes return `{findings, metrics, duration_ms}`. See `probes-docs.md` for invocation details and severity escalation.
- **Feature probes agent** (`skills/discovery/probes-feature.md`): intent-drift + stubbed-dead-feature + feature-request-cluster probes. The first two MUST carry file_path:line_number anchors that survive the Phase 4.2 re-read (±3 lines); feature-request-cluster instead anchors on a VCS issue-ID set and MUST carry `verification_method: vcs-issue` — see Phase 4.2's dual verification path below.

Each agent receives:
- The probe definitions from `probes-intro.md` (confidence scoring reference) AND the category-specific `probes-<category>.md` file for this agent's category (include the actual grep commands/patterns in the prompt)
- The exclude paths list
- The project root path
- When `since_ref` was provided and `changedFiles` is non-empty: the `changedFiles` array (informational context for per-probe filtering — per-probe filtering enforcement is deferred to W3)
- Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (read-only -- no Edit/Write)
- Instruction: "Run each probe. For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:"

```
FINDING:
  probe: <probe_name>
  category: <category>
  severity: <critical|high|medium|low>
  file_path: <absolute path>
  line_number: <number>
  matched_text: <exact text from tool output>
  title: <short title for the finding>
  description: <1-2 sentence description>
  recommended_fix: <concrete fix suggestion>
```

"If a probe's activation condition is not met, skip it with: SKIPPED: <probe_name> -- <reason>"
"If a probe command fails, skip it with: FAILED: <probe_name> -- <error>"
"Do NOT fabricate findings. Only report what tool output confirms."

CRITICAL: `run_in_background: false` for all agents.

Skip categories with no activated probes (don't dispatch empty agents).

## Phase 4: Verification & Scoring

After all probe agents complete:

### 4.1 Parse Findings

Collect all `FINDING:` blocks from agent outputs into a unified findings list.

### 4.2 Verification Pass

For EACH finding, use the verification path matching how the finding is anchored:

**Default path — file-anchored findings (no `verification_method` field, or `verification_method: file-line`):**
1. Read the file at `file_path:line_number` using the Read tool
2. Confirm `matched_text` appears at or near that line (+/-3 lines tolerance)
3. If NOT confirmed, discard with note "false positive -- text not found at reported location"

**VCS-issue-anchored findings (`verification_method: vcs-issue`)** — e.g. `feature-request-cluster`, whose findings anchor on a set of issue IDs rather than a file location:
1. For each issue ID in the finding's `Location` set, verify it via the VCS CLI — syntax reference: `skills/gitlab-ops/SKILL.md` § "Common CLI Commands" (`glab issue view <IID>` / `gh issue view <NUMBER>`); do not duplicate the CLI syntax here
2. Confirm the issue exists and is still open (`state` != closed)
3. If an issue ID no longer resolves or was closed since detection, drop it from the `Location` set; if EVERY issue in the set is gone/closed, discard the finding entirely with note "false positive -- all referenced issues closed/removed since detection"

4. Report: "Verification: N confirmed, M discarded as false positives"

### 4.2a Confidence Scoring

For each verified finding, assign a confidence score (0-100) based on three factors:

| Factor | Low (+0) | Medium (+10) | High (+20) |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Pattern specificity | Generic match (URL, TODO) | Moderate (orphaned annotation, magic number) | Specific (API key regex, eval(), SQL injection) |
| File context | Test fixture, example, seed data, docs | Utility, config, scripts | Production source, API handler, middleware |
| Historical signal | Previously dismissed as false positive | No prior data (first occurrence) | Recurring issue (confirmed in learnings.jsonl) |

**Scoring rules:**
1. Start at 40 (baseline)
2. Add each factor's score (+0/+10/+20)
3. Clamp to 0-100 range
4. **Critical severity override:** findings with severity `critical` get a minimum confidence of 70 — they are NEVER auto-deferred

**Threshold:** Read `discovery-confidence-threshold` from Session Config (default: 60). If not configured, use 60.

Annotate each finding with its confidence score for Phase 5 presentation.

### 4.3 Deduplication

Two findings are duplicates if:
- Same `file_path` AND
- Overlapping line range (+/-5 lines) AND
- Different probes

Keep the higher severity finding. Merge descriptions.

### 4.4 Apply Thresholds

1. **Severity filter:** Remove findings below `discovery-severity-threshold` from Session Config.
2. **Confidence filter:** Remove findings with confidence score below `discovery-confidence-threshold` (default: 60). Log filtered-out findings: "Auto-dismissed N low-confidence findings (below threshold [T]). Use `discovery-confidence-threshold: 0` to see all."

### 4.5 Group by Category

Group remaining findings by category for Phase 5 presentation.

### 4.6 Embedded Mode Exit

If in embedded mode (called from session-end): STOP HERE. Return structured findings to the caller using this schema:

**Embedded mode return schema:**
```json
{
  "findings": [
    {"probe": "string", "category": "string", "severity": "critical|high|medium|low", "confidence": 0-100, "file": "string", "line": number, "description": "string", "recommendation": "string"}
  ],
  "stats": {
    "probes_run": number,
    "findings_raw": number,
    "findings_verified": number,
    "false_positives": number,
    "user_dismissed": 0,
    "issues_created": 0,
    "by_category": {"<category>": {"findings": number, "actioned": 0}}
  }
}
```

Present both as structured data in your final output. Do not proceed to Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Interactive Triage (Standalone Mode Only)

### 5.0 Load Triage State & Partition Findings

Before auto-defer and before presenting any findings for triage, load the persistent discovery triage state and filter findings through it:

1. Call `loadTriageState()` from `scripts/lib/discovery/triage-state.mjs` (uses default path `.orchestrator/metrics/discovery-triage.jsonl`). Returns an empty Map if the file does not exist — no error.
2. Call `filterFindings({ findings: verifiedFindings, stateMap })` to partition findings into three buckets:
   - `toShow` — state is `open`, `reopened`, or **no prior state entry** (new findings — present for user triage)
   - `suppressed` — state is `dismissed` or `accepted-as-known` (skip silently)
   - `tracked` — state is `promoted-to-#NNN` (issue already filed; show as informational)

3. Emit a one-line state banner before the summary table:
   ```
   Triage state: [N suppressed] suppressed (dismissed/accepted-as-known), [N tracked] tracked in existing issues. Presenting [N toShow] findings.
   ```
   Omit the banner entirely if all three counts are zero (first run).

4. Render `tracked` findings as informational lines in the summary — NOT as interactive triage items:
   ```
   [INFO] Finding "<title>" (<file_path>) is tracked in #<issue_id> — not re-triaged.
   ```

5. Continue Phase 5 triage using only `toShow` findings. The `suppressed` bucket requires no user interaction.

6. After the user completes triage (Steps 1-4 below), append state changes to `.orchestrator/metrics/discovery-triage.jsonl` via `appendTriageEntry()` from `triage-state.mjs`:
   - User selects "Create issue" → append `{ fingerprint, state: 'promoted-to-#<issue_id>', issue_id: <N>, timestamp, session_id }`
   - User selects "Dismiss -- intentional" or "Dismiss -- false positive" → append `{ fingerprint, state: 'dismissed', user_decision: '<reason>', timestamp, session_id }`
   - User selects "Accept all" for batch → append one `{ fingerprint, state: 'open', ... }` entry per finding (so they re-appear next run if not yet promoted)

### 5.1 Auto-Defer Low-Confidence Findings

Before presenting findings for triage, separate by confidence threshold:

1. Findings with confidence >= threshold → present for interactive triage (below)
2. Findings with confidence < threshold → auto-defer with summary:
   "Auto-deferred [N] low-confidence findings (score < [threshold]). Review with `/discovery --include-deferred`."
3. List auto-deferred findings in a collapsed section (not interactive — informational only)

### 5.1 Present High-Confidence Findings

Present findings using AskUserQuestion -- NEVER plain text options. On Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists.

Include confidence scores in the presentation:
```
[CRITICAL] (confidence: 85) hardcoded-values: API key found in src/config.ts:42
[HIGH] (confidence: 72) security-basics: eval() usage in src/utils/parser.ts:18
[MEDIUM] (confidence: 61) orphaned-annotations: TODO without issue in src/lib/auth.ts:55
```

### Step 1: Summary

Present a findings overview table:

```
## Discovery Results

Probes run: [N] | Findings verified: [N] | False positives discarded: [N]

| Category | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Total |
|----------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|
| Code     | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Infra    | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| UI       | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Arch     | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Session  | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Audit    | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Vault    | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Feature  | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
```

### Step 2: Critical + High Findings -- Review Individually

For each Critical or High finding, use AskUserQuestion (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "<finding title>\n\n<file_path>:<line_number>\n```\n<matched_text with +/-3 lines context>\n```\n\n<description>\n\nRecommended fix: <recommended_fix>",
    header: "<severity>",
    options: [
      { label: "Create issue (<severity>)", description: "Create a priority::<severity> issue for this finding" },
      { label: "Adjust priority", description: "Create issue with different priority" },
      { label: "Dismiss -- intentional", description: "This is by design, skip" },
      { label: "Dismiss -- false positive", description: "Detection was wrong, skip" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

If user selects "Adjust priority", ask which priority with another AskUserQuestion. On Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists.

### Step 3: Medium + Low Findings -- Review Batched

Group remaining findings by category. For each category with medium/low findings (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "[N] medium/low findings in [category]:\n\n1. [title] -- [file_path]:[line] ([severity])\n2. [title] -- [file_path]:[line] ([severity])\n...",
    header: "[Category]",
    options: [
      { label: "Accept all (Recommended)", description: "Create issues for all [N] findings" },
      { label: "Review individually", description: "Walk through each finding one by one" },
      { label: "Dismiss all", description: "Skip all medium/low findings in this category" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

If "Review individually" selected, walk through each like Step 2.

### Step 4: Batch Confirmation

Before creating any issues (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Ready to create [N] issues?\n\n- [X] critical\n- [Y] high\n- [Z] medium\n- [W] low",
    header: "Confirm",
    options: [
      { label: "Create all [N] issues", description: "Proceed with issue creation" },
      { label: "Review list first", description: "Show full list before creating" },
      { label: "Cancel", description: "Do not create any issues" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Phase 6: Issue Creation & Report

### 6.1 Issue Creation

> **VCS Reference:** Detect the VCS platform per the "VCS Auto-Detection" section of the gitlab-ops skill.
> Use CLI commands per the "Common CLI Commands" section.

For each approved finding:

1. Format using the Discovery Finding Issue Template from `issue-templates.md`
2. Determine labels: `type:discovery` + `priority::<level>` + `area:<inferred from category/filepath>` + `status:ready`
3. Create issue via VCS CLI:
   - **GitLab**: `glab issue create --title "[Discovery] <title>" --label "type:discovery,priority::<level>,area:<area>,status:ready" --description "<body>"`
   - **GitHub**: `gh issue create --title "[Discovery] <title>" --label "type:discovery,priority::<level>,area:<area>,status:ready" --body "<body>"`
4. Brief pause (1s) between creations for rate limiting

### 6.2 Final Report

When the active scope included `feature` AND at least one verified feature finding was approved into an issue, insert an **Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) section** between `### Created Issues` and `### Dismissed Findings` (shown below). This section is feature-scope-only — every other category keeps the flat `### Created Issues` table as its sole findings view, unchanged.

```
## Discovery Report

### Summary
- Probes run: [N] across [categories]
- Raw findings: [N]
- Verified: [N] (false positives discarded: [M])
- User approved: [N]
- Issues created: [N]

### Created Issues
| # | Title | Priority | Area | Probe |
|---|-------|----------|------|-------|
| <IID> | <title> | <priority> | <area> | <probe> |

### Opportunity Solution Tree (feature scope only)
> Present ONLY when the active scope included `feature` and at least one verified feature finding was approved. Group the approved feature findings under a Teresa Torres OST hierarchy: **outcome** (the user/business result the product is steering toward) -> **opportunity** (the observed gap or unmet need the finding surfaces) -> **solution** (the finding itself — the created issue). Infer outcome/opportunity from the finding's probe + description; never fabricate a hierarchy level with no evidentiary basis — when the outcome is genuinely unclear, write "Outcome: (unclassified)" rather than guessing.

Example:
Outcome: Reduce time-to-first-value for new users
  Opportunity: Onboarding drops users before they reach the "aha" moment (intent-drift: docs claim auto-provisioning, code path is manual)
    Solution: #182 -- Implement auto-provisioning of default workspace
  Opportunity: Users repeatedly request the same missing capability without a tracked epic
    Solution: #191, #204, #211 -- feature-request-cluster: "CSV export" cluster (3 issues, no epic)

### Dismissed Findings
- [N] dismissed as intentional
- [M] dismissed as false positive

### Recommendations
- [suggestions based on finding patterns]
```

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** fabricate findings -- every finding must come from tool output with verifiable evidence
- **NEVER** create issues without user approval (standalone mode)
- **ALWAYS** verify findings by re-reading the file at the reported line (Phase 4)
- **ALWAYS** use AskUserQuestion for triage decisions -- never plain text options (On Codex CLI, use numbered lists as AskUserQuestion is not available)
- **ALWAYS** reference gitlab-ops for VCS operations -- never duplicate CLI logic inline
- If a probe command fails or tool is unavailable, skip gracefully, continue with others
- If in embedded mode, stop after Phase 4, return findings as structured data
- Respect `discovery-severity-threshold` -- filter before presenting to user
- Default exclude paths always apply: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `coverage/`

## Phase 7: Capture Discovery Stats (Standalone Mode Only)

> This phase runs only in standalone mode. Embedded mode returns findings to the caller.

After Phase 6 (Issue Creation) completes, prepare discovery statistics for session metrics:

1. Count totals from the triage results:
   - `probes_run`: number of probes that were activated and executed
   - `findings_raw`: total findings before verification
   - `findings_verified`: findings that passed Phase 4.2 verification
   - `false_positives`: findings discarded during verification
   - `user_dismissed`: findings the user declined during Phase 5 triage
   - `issues_created`: issues created in Phase 6
   - `by_category`: per-category breakdown of findings and actioned items

2. Report stats summary:
   ```
   Discovery stats: [probes_run] probes, [findings_raw] raw → [findings_verified] verified ([false_positives] false positives). User dismissed [user_dismissed]. Created [issues_created] issues.
   ```

3. These stats are available for session-end to include in `sessions.jsonl` under the `discovery_stats` field. The discovery skill does NOT write to `sessions.jsonl` directly — session-end handles that.

## Discovery Triage State (#419)

Persistent triage state prevents re-presenting the same finding on every `/discovery` run. State is stored in an append-only JSONL file and keyed by a stable fingerprint.

### State File

**Location:** `.orchestrator/metrics/discovery-triage.jsonl` (gitignored via `.orchestrator/metrics/*.jsonl` pattern — machine-local, never committed)

**Format:** One JSON object per line:
```json
{"fingerprint":"aabb1122ccdd3344","state":"dismissed","user_decision":"intentional — debug log","timestamp":"2026-05-17T10:00:00.000Z","session_id":"deep-2"}
{"fingerprint":"eeff5566aabb7788","state":"promoted-to-#119","issue_id":119,"timestamp":"2026-05-17T10:01:00.000Z","session_id":"deep-2"}
```

### Fingerprint

`computeFingerprint({probe, file, severity, ruleId})` → 16-char hex (sha256 prefix).

`line_number` is **intentionally excluded** — it drifts on refactoring without the underlying issue changing. A finding is considered "the same" as long as the probe, file path, severity, and ruleId match.

### State Enum

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `open` | Actively needs triage or was explicitly marked for re-review |
| `dismissed` | User dismissed as intentional or false positive — suppressed on future runs |
| `accepted-as-known` | Known issue, accepted without creating a VCS issue — suppressed on future runs |
| `reopened` | Previously suppressed but re-surfaced by user decision — shown again |
| `promoted-to-#NNN` | VCS issue created; shown informational ("tracked in #NNN") on future runs |

### Re-run Semantics

On each `/discovery` run, Phase 5 loads the state file and partitions findings before presenting them:

- **New findings** (no fingerprint entry) → always shown
- **`open` or `reopened`** → shown for triage
- **`dismissed` or `accepted-as-known`** → suppressed (silent — no user interaction needed)
- **`promoted-to-#NNN`** → informational line only ("tracked in #NNN")

A suppressed finding re-appears only if its fingerprint changes — i.e., the probe, file path, severity, or ruleId changes. No TTL on dismissed state.

### Module

`scripts/lib/discovery/triage-state.mjs` — pure ESM, Node stdlib only. Exports:
- `computeFingerprint({probe, file, severity, ruleId}): string`
- `loadTriageState(stateFilePath?): Promise<Map<fingerprint, entry>>`
- `appendTriageEntry(stateFilePath, entry): Promise<void>`
- `filterFindings({findings, stateMap}): {toShow, suppressed, tracked}`

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** report findings without verifying them first — false positives erode user trust faster than missed issues
- **DO NOT** skip the interactive triage phase — auto-creating issues for unconfirmed findings creates noise
- **DO NOT** run probes outside the configured scope — if the user asked for `code` scope, don't scan infrastructure
- **DO NOT** present findings without evidence (file path, line number, actual content) — assertions without proof are useless
- **DO NOT** write to `sessions.jsonl` directly — session-end handles metrics persistence
