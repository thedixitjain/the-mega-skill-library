# Executable spec for Doc readme mode — gold-standard README generation.
# Doc readme mode drafts or improves a README that converts skimmers into users and satisfies
# deep readers, enforcing 8 non-negotiable patterns (problem-first lead, trust block
# near install, collapse-don't-delete depth, adoption-ordered sections), then runs
# deterministic checks and reports evidence. Hexagon: supporting; consumes: project files
# + interview answers; produces: documentation (README.md) and factual check results.

Feature: README generation converts skimmers into users and reports evidence
  As an author publishing a tool
  I want a README that leads with the problem, proves it works, and earns trust
  So that both skimmers and deep readers adopt instead of bouncing

  Background:
    Given a repository with manifest files and an optional existing README.md

  Scenario: Mode detection routes by flags and existing README
    When Doc readme mode runs
    Then "--validate" with an existing README skips to deterministic review only
    And "--rewrite" with an existing README reuses it as rewrite context
    And no README and no flags generates from scratch after an interview

  Scenario: The lead states the problem before the framework
    When the README is generated
    Then the opening line names the user's pain in one plain sentence
    And methodology or framework names do not appear before the problem statement

  Scenario: A trust block sits near the install command
    Given the author reports that the tool runs hooks, modifies config, or makes network calls
    When the README is generated
    Then a trust block stating what it touches, exfiltration posture, and how to uninstall
      appears near the install command, not buried in an FAQ

  Scenario: Depth is collapsed, never deleted
    When deep architecture, theory, or reference material is included
    Then it is placed inside <details> blocks with a blank line after <summary>
    And the skimmer path stays short while deep readers can expand

  Scenario: De-slopify runs before deterministic checks
    When generation or rewrite finishes
    Then Doc runs the de-slopify pass from references/de-slopify.md on README.md
    And applies manual recasts before validator and anti-pattern checks

  Scenario: Checks run before the skill reports its evidence
    When generation or rewrite finishes
    Then Doc runs its README validator and anti-pattern checks once
    And reports checked and unchecked scope without a semantic verdict or continuation decision

  Scenario: Anti-patterns are flagged on rewrite or validate
    When Doc readme mode reviews an existing README
    Then it flags flywheel-echo, framework-first, guru tone, buried trust info,
      install scatter, theory-before-try, and AI slop prose with a concrete fix for each
