# Project Map Find

Use `.wingman/project-map/` to narrow candidate capabilities, then verify source before strong claims. The project map is a discovery map, not final authority.

## Core Rule

Read indexes first, select a small candidate set, and verify source before strong claims. Do not turn a project-map lookup into a full repository scan unless the map is missing or clearly insufficient.

## Gate

Continue only when the user needs to locate an existing capability, compare similar implementations, map a project concept, or check for reuse/reference candidates. If the task is only editing, explaining, testing, or styling and does not ask about existing capability discovery, do not use this skill.

## Core Behavior

Answer questions like:

- whether a project already has a feature, flow, component, module, utility, pattern, contract, or concept
- where that capability lives
- what the closest matches do
- whether to reuse, extend, wrap, reference, avoid, or create new
- what source should be read next

## Lookup Workflow

1. Extract intent:
   - `Locate`: find where something is.
   - `Compare`: compare similar capabilities.
   - `Reuse Decision`: decide reuse/extend/wrap/reference/create.
   - `Concept Mapping`: map user language to project code names.
   - `Implementation Prep`: find precedents before building.

2. Check project-map availability.
   - If `.wingman/project-map/` is missing, say no project map exists yet.
   - Offer source search if useful, but do not present source-search results as map results.
   - If source search finds a durable capability, recommend `project-map-catalog`.

3. Read the smallest useful index set.
   - Always read `.wingman/project-map/index.md` when present.
   - Read `.wingman/project-map/glossary/index.md` when present.
   - Add section indexes based on intent: `features`, `flows`, `surfaces`, `components`, `modules`, `utilities`, `patterns`, `contracts`, or `domains`.
   - Read `relationships/index.md` only when it exists and the query needs cross-entry relationships.

4. Expand terms.
   - Use glossary, tags, source paths, route names, API names, business aliases, and old names.
   - Search the map for query words and expanded terms.

5. Select candidates.
   - Pick up to 5 feature/flow/domain candidates.
   - Pick up to 5 implementation candidates.
   - Pick up to 3 glossary/contract candidates.
   - For ambiguous ranking, read `references/candidate-ranking.md`.

6. Read only selected entries.
   - Prefer this order when relevant: domain -> glossary -> feature/flow -> surface -> module/component/utility/pattern/contract.
   - Do not read every entry unless indexes are missing, stale, or clearly insufficient.

7. Verify source before strong claims.
   - Source verification is required before claiming an exact route/path is current, implementation is reusable, API/type/schema shape, preferred/deprecated status, or behavior details not directly present in a source-verified entry.
   - Source verification may be skipped when the user only wants a rough map or the answer explicitly says "project map says" and labels unverified/stale evidence.

## Decisions

Use these decision labels:

- `Locate`: found where it lives, not necessarily reusable.
- `Reuse`: directly use existing implementation.
- `Extend`: expand the same semantic responsibility.
- `Wrap`: wrap existing capability with context, defaults, permissions, or layout.
- `Reference`: follow the flow/pattern but do not reuse code directly.
- `Avoid`: similar but should not be used.
- `Create New`: no suitable candidate.
- `Catalog Needed`: source search found a capability not in the project map.

## Output

Put the strongest answer first:

```markdown
Found: Yes | Partial | No

Closest Matches:

- `[Entry Name]`: [what it does]
  - Where: `[path/route]`
  - Traits: [key traits]
  - Decision: Locate | Reuse | Extend | Wrap | Reference | Avoid | Create New | Catalog Needed
  - Evidence: [entry/source]

Recommended Next Step:
[read source / reuse module / create new / catalog missing feature]

Gaps:
[missing entry, stale verification, no map coverage]
```

If no good match exists, say so directly. Distinguish "project map has no match" from "source search found no match".

## References

- Read `references/candidate-ranking.md` only when the index yields multiple plausible candidates or the best candidate is unclear.
- Read `references/output-examples.md` only when shaping a complex final response.
- Do not read all references for simple "where is X?" lookups.

## Ask The User When

- The query lacks a capability, concept, domain, or implementation target.
- Multiple user meanings are plausible and would lead to different searches.
- The user asks for a reuse decision but the required behavior or constraints are underspecified.

## Checklist

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] I read the smallest useful index set first.
- [ ] I selected a limited candidate set.
- [ ] I read only relevant entries.
- [ ] I verified source before strong claims, or clearly labeled unverified map results.
- [ ] I included evidence and gaps.
