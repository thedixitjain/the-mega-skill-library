# /orbit — Complete Orbit

**CRITICAL**: Run `HARNESS_DIR=$(epic path)` first. NEVER use `.harness/` in the project directory.

You are entering **Orbit** mode — the full autonomous pipeline from spec to PR in one shot.

## Phase Recovery Protocol

At the start of **every response** during an active orbit:

1. Run `ls $HARNESS_DIR/orbit/PIPELINE-*.json 2>/dev/null`
2. Find the file with `"status": "running"`
3. Read it. Verify `phase` matches where you left off
4. **If `phase` is ahead of where you think you are, trust the file** — you may have compacted
5. **Conflict resolution (crash-mid-update)**: If `phase_history` contains an entry for the current `phase` with a completed timestamp, treat that phase as done and advance to the next phase — `phase_history` wins over the `phase` field when they disagree.
6. Resume from the resolved phase. Do NOT re-ask mode selection, re-run spec, or re-discover
7. **Worktree recovery**: If `worktree_name` is set in pipeline state:
   - Check if worktree still exists: `git worktree list | grep "{worktree_name}"`
   - If exists: `cd` into the worktree path to continue work
   - If not found: worktree was cleaned up externally — abort orbit with warning, set `"status": "aborted"`

If no file with `"status": "running"` exists, orbit was not started or has completed. Do not invent one.

**Crash recovery**: If `updated_at` is older than 45 minutes and the pipeline is in `status: running`, assume a crash occurred. Read the state, determine the last completed phase from `phase_history` (rule 5 above applies), and resume from there. Report the recovery to the user.

## Step 0: Preflight

Initialize pipeline state at `$HARNESS_DIR/orbit/PIPELINE-{timestamp}.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "{timestamp}",
  "mode": null,
  "phase": "auto_detect",
  "status": "running",
  "spec_file": null,
  "goal_slug": null,
  "branch": null,
  "worktree_name": null,
  "original_cwd": null,
  "audit_fail_count": 0,
  "max_retries": 3,
  "audit_report": null,
  "deadline": "{ISO-8601, now + 30 minutes}",
  "started_at": "{ISO-8601}",
  "updated_at": "{ISO-8601}",
  "phase_history": []
}
```

## Step 1: Auto-Detect Mode

**DO NOT ask the user for mode selection.** Auto-detect the best path:

### Detection Logic

| Signal | Mode | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| PRD / detailed requirements doc exists in project | `council` | Rich input → council synthesizes best approach |
| User request is specific and actionable (clear goal, defined scope) | `direct` | No need for discovery — spec directly |
| User request is vague, unfocused, or "I want to..." without specifics | `council` | Council frames the problem better than guessing |
| User explicitly says "interactive" or "let me discover first" | `interactive` | Respect explicit preference |

### Detection Process

1. Check for PRD/requirements docs: `ls {project}/PRD*.md {project}/docs/PRD*.md {project}/requirements*.md 2>/dev/null`
2. Evaluate user request clarity:
   - **Specific**: contains concrete feature descriptions, acceptance criteria, or technical constraints → `direct`
   - **Vague**: "build X", "improve Y", "add Z" without details → `council`
3. Record detected mode in pipeline state (`"mode": "direct|council|interactive"`)
4. Report mode choice to user as a **notification**, not a question: `"Orbit mode: {mode} (auto-detected)"`
5. Proceed immediately to the matching step below — **do not wait for confirmation**

## Step 2A: Direct Mode (clear request → auto-spec)

**Use when**: Request is specific and actionable.

1. Read the user's request + any existing docs (PRD, README, AGENTS.md)
2. Generate spec directly at `$HARNESS_DIR/specs/SPEC-{timestamp}.md` with `status: approved`
3. Record via `epic mem add --title "Orbit: {mode} mode decision" --type decision --importance 0.9 --body "CONTEXT"`
4. **Proceed immediately to Step 3** — no approval gate

## Step 2B: Council Auto-Spec (complex/vague request → council)

**Use when**: PRD exists or request needs framing.

1. Gather the user's request from conversation context
2. Launch 4 parallel sub-agents (Architect, Skeptic, Pragmatist, Critic) — each receives ONLY the request + codebase context, NOT the full conversation (anti-anchoring)
3. Synthesize: list agreement/disagreement, produce recommended approach
4. Generate spec at `$HARNESS_DIR/specs/SPEC-{timestamp}.md` with `status: approved`
5. Record via `epic mem add --title "Orbit: council decision" --type decision --importance 0.9 --body "CONTEXT"`
6. **Proceed immediately to Step 3** — no approval gate, no "orbit go"

## Step 2C: Interactive Mode (explicit user choice only)

**Use when**: User explicitly requested interactive mode.

1. Tell user to run `/discover` → `/spec`, then say "orbit go". STOP and wait.
2. On resume: load latest `SPEC-*.md` with `status: approved`. Proceed to Step 3.

**This mode is never auto-selected.** It requires explicit user opt-in.

## Step 3: Build (Go)

1. Load spec, extract `goal_slug`
2. **Git preflight**: verify clean working tree and not on detached HEAD:
   ```bash
   [ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ] || (echo "ERROR: Dirty working tree or untracked files. Commit or stash first." && exit 1)
   git symbolic-ref -q HEAD || (echo "ERROR: Detached HEAD. Checkout a branch first." && exit 1)
   ```
3. **Worktree isolation**: Create an isolated git worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree add .claude/worktrees/orbit-{goal_slug} -b orbit-{goal_slug} origin/{default-branch}
   cd .claude/worktrees/orbit-{goal_slug}
   ```
   - Record `worktree_name` and `original_cwd` in pipeline state
4. Plan tasks from Requirements (R1, R2...)
5. Execute with sub-agents — TDD, debug on failure, verify before done
6. Handle states: DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED
7. Integrate: full test suite, verify ACs

## Step 4: Audit

1. Gather scope via `git diff --stat`
2. Classify changed files (API, Frontend, DB, Backend, Tests, Infra)
3. Launch parallel sub-agents: Reviewer, Auditor, Test runner (+ scope-specific)
4. Synthesize Audit Report: Quality/Security/Performance PASS/WARN/FAIL + Spec Coverage
5. **PRESERVE audit report** in pipeline state `audit_report` field

## Step 5: Verdict

- **All PASS + all AC verified** → proceed to Eval (if eval.yaml exists) or Ship
- **WARN** → log, auto-proceed
- **FAIL** → increment `audit_fail_count`:
  - `< 3`: plan fixes from action items, execute, return to Step 4
  - `≥ 3`: **PAUSE** — ask user "continue or abort?"

## Step 5.5: Eval (optional — only if eval.yaml or benchmarks exist)

1. Check for eval config — eval is active if ANY of these exist:
   - `$HARNESS_DIR/eval/eval.yaml`
   - `benchmarks/baselines/latest.json` in CWD (in-repo baseline)
   - `benchmarks/eval_runner.py` in CWD (auto-detected benchmark)
2. If eval is active, run `epic eval --json` via the **eval** skill
3. **Eval PASS** → proceed to Ship
4. **Eval FAIL (regression detected)** → increment `audit_fail_count`:
   - `< 3`: plan fixes, execute, return to Step 4
   - `≥ 3`: **PAUSE** — ask user "continue or abort?"
5. If no eval config and no benchmarks detected, skip this step entirely

## Step 6: Ship

1. **Gate**: verify PASS audit report exists
2. **Integration verification** — run directly in worktree:
   - Clean build artifacts first: `cargo clean` / `npm run clean` / equivalent
   - Full build from scratch · complete test suite · linter + formatter
   - Fail → STOP. Do NOT create PR.
3. **Git hygiene**: conventional commits, rebase, squash fixups
4. **Create PR** via `gh pr create` with spec + audit report in body
5. **CI watch** via `gh pr checks --watch`, auto-fix failures
6. **Exit worktree**: Return to original directory and keep the worktree

## Step 7: Evolve

Run the evolution engine to analyze this session and generate/improve skills.

1. **Always run** — regardless of CI outcome:
   ```bash
   epic-harness reflect
   ```
   This triggers the Ring 3 loop: observe → analyze → seed evolved skills → update metrics.

   If `$HARNESS_DIR/pending_synth.jsonl` has records with `status: "pending"`,
   synthesize each — launch one subagent per manifest (use your host's subagent
   mechanism; do NOT name a model or CLI), then apply the body it produced:
   ```bash
   epic-harness evolve accept-synth --skill <name> --file <body.md>
   ```
   Unconsumed manifests leave the template skill body in place.

2. **If CI green** (all checks passed): additionally run
   ```bash
   epic-harness reflect --context --days 1
   ```
   and record the successful orbit pattern into memory:
   ```bash
   epic mem add --title "Orbit: {goal_slug} succeeded" \
     --type pattern --importance 0.7 \
     --body "Orbit completed. Mode: {mode}. AC: all verified. PR: {url}. Stack: {stack}."
   ```

3. Report the evolution outcome in the final summary (evolved skills generated, score trend).

4. Update pipeline state: `"phase": "evolve"`, `"status": "complete"`.

## Step 8: Report

```
## Orbit Complete
- Pipeline: PIPELINE-{id}
- Mode: {direct|council|interactive} (auto-detected)
- Spec: SPEC-{timestamp} ({goal_slug})
- Branch: orbit-{goal_slug}
- Worktree: orbit-{goal_slug} (preserved for PR)
- PR: {URL}
- Audit retries: {count}

### Phase Summary
| Phase | Status | Retries |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Spec | approved | 0 |
| Go | complete | 0 |
| Audit | PASS | {count} |
| Eval | {PASS|SKIPPED} | 0 |
| Ship | complete | 0 |
| Evolve | complete | 0 |

### Evolution
- Skills evolved: {count}
- Score trend: {improving|stable|declining}
```

## Red Flags
- Interactive mode proceeding without spec approval (direct and council modes auto-approve)
- Continuing after 3 audit failures without user consent
- Skipping isolated integration test
- Shipping with FAIL in security audits
- Losing audit report between phases
- Creating branch with dirty working tree
- Losing worktree reference between phases
- Skipping evolve step after ship (evolve must always run, even if CI fails)
