> **Host: Codex CLI** — This skill was designed for Claude Code and adapted for Codex.
> Cross-reference commands use installed skill names in Codex rather than `/octo:*` slash commands.
> Use the active Codex shell and subagent tools. Do not claim a provider, model, or host subagent is available until the current session exposes it.
> For host tool equivalents, see `skills/blocks/codex-host-adapter.md`.


# Environment Doctor

## Overview

Run environment diagnostics across 11 check categories. Identifies misconfigured providers, stale state, broken hooks, and other issues that prevent Claude Octopus from working correctly.

**Core principle:** Detect problems before they surface in workflows.


## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**
- Something isn't working and you're not sure why
- After installing or updating the plugin
- Before a demo or important workflow run
- Checking if providers are properly authenticated
- Verifying scheduler, hooks, or skills are correctly configured

**Do NOT use for:**
- First-time setup (use `/octo:setup` — it guides configuration)
- Project workflow status (use `/octo:status`)
- Debugging application code (use `/octo:debug`)


## The Process

### Step 1: Resolve Plugin Root and Run Full Diagnostics

Use this resolver before running Octopus scripts. Do not assume
`~/.claude-octopus/plugin` exists; Windows Git Bash installs may not support the
stable symlink. Run this as a single Bash call.

```bash
OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}"
if [[ -z "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT" || ! -x "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orchestrate.sh" ]]; then
  OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT="${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin"
fi
if [[ ! -x "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orchestrate.sh" ]] && command -v octopus >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  OCTO_BIN="$(command -v octopus)"
  OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$OCTO_BIN")/.." && pwd)"
fi
if [[ ! -x "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orchestrate.sh" ]]; then
  OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(
    find "${HOME}/.claude/plugins" -type f -path "*/scripts/orchestrate.sh" -print 2>/dev/null \
      | sed 's#/scripts/orchestrate.sh$##' \
      | grep -E '(nyldn-plugins|claude-octopus|/octo(/[0-9]|$))' \
      | sort \
      | tail -1
  )"
fi
if [[ -z "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT" || ! -x "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orchestrate.sh" ]]; then
  echo "Claude Octopus plugin root not found. Reinstall the octo plugin, then retry doctor diagnostics."
  exit 1
fi
mkdir -p "${HOME}/.claude-octopus"
_octo_stable="${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin"
if [[ ! -L "$_octo_stable" ]] || [[ "$(cd "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)" != "$(cd "$_octo_stable" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)" ]]; then
  [[ -L "$_octo_stable" || -f "$_octo_stable" ]] && rm -f "$_octo_stable" 2>/dev/null || true
  ln -s "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT" "$_octo_stable" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
unset _octo_stable
export OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT
bash "$OCTO_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor
```

This runs all 11 check categories and displays a formatted report.

### Step 2: Filter by Category (Optional)

If the user asks about a specific area, filter:

```bash
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor providers
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor auth
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor config
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor state
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor smoke
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor hooks
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor scheduler
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor skills
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor conflicts
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor agents
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor recurrence
```

### Step 3: Check & Install Dependencies

Run the dependency checker to find missing CLIs, statusline config, and recommended plugins:

```bash
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/install-deps.sh" check
```

If the check reports missing deps, offer to install them:

```bash
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/install-deps.sh" install
```

This auto-installs: Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, jq, and the statusline resolver. Antigravity CLI (`agy`) setup is detected and reported with install guidance. For plugins (claude-mem, document-skills), it prints `/plugin install` commands the user must run manually.

### Step 4: Verbose or JSON Output

```bash
# Detailed output for troubleshooting
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor --verbose

# Machine-readable output
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor --json

# Combine: specific category + verbose
bash "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" doctor auth --verbose
```

### Step 5: Interactive Remediation (MANDATORY for fixable issues)

After running diagnostics, if ANY fixable issues are found, you MUST use AskUserQuestion to offer fixes. Do NOT just print instructions — offer to execute them.

**RTK not installed:**
```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "RTK saves 60-90% on bash output tokens. Install it now?",
    header: "Install RTK",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {label: "Install via brew (Recommended)", description: "brew install rtk — fast, macOS"},
      {label: "Install via cargo", description: "cargo install rtk-token-killer"},
      {label: "Skip", description: "Continue without RTK"}
    ]
  }]
})
```
If user chooses install, run it, then offer hook setup.

**RTK installed but hook not configured on macOS/Linux:**

On Windows Git Bash, do not offer `rtk init -g`. RTK uses CLAUDE.md injection
mode there, so report the hook check as skipped.

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "RTK is installed but the Claude Code hook isn't active. Configure it?",
    header: "RTK Hook",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {label: "Run rtk init -g (Recommended)", description: "Auto-installs Claude Code bash hook on macOS/Linux"},
      {label: "Skip", description: "I'll configure it later"}
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Missing optional providers:**
```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Some providers are missing. Install them?",
    header: "Providers",
    multiSelect: true,
    options: [
      {label: "Codex CLI", description: "npm install -g @openai/codex"},
      {label: "Gemini CLI", description: "brew install gemini-cli (macOS)"},
      {label: "Antigravity CLI", description: "Install agy, then verify with agy --version && agy models"},
      {label: "Skip all", description: "Continue with available providers"}
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Auth expired:**
Offer to run the login command for the expired provider.

**Multiple fixable issues:** Batch them into a single AskUserQuestion with multiSelect where appropriate, rather than asking one at a time.


## Check Categories

| Category | What it checks |
|----------|---------------|
| `providers` | Claude Code version, Codex CLI installed, Gemini CLI installed, Antigravity CLI installed, Perplexity API key, Ollama local LLM (server + models), circuit breaker status, provider fallback history |
| `auth` | Authentication status for each provider |
| `config` | Plugin version, install scope, feature flags |
| `state` | Project state.json, stale results, workspace writable |
| `smoke` | Smoke test cache, model configuration |
| `hooks` | hooks.json validity, hook scripts |
| `scheduler` | Scheduler daemon, jobs, budget gates, kill switches |
| `skills` | Skill files loaded and valid |
| `conflicts` | Conflicting plugins detection |
| `agents` | Agent definitions, worktree isolation, CLI registration, version compatibility |
| `recurrence` | Failure pattern detection — flags repeated quality gate failures, source hotspots, 48h trends |
| `deps` | Software dependencies — Node.js, jq, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity CLIs, RTK token compression (gain stats + hook status), statusline resolver, recommended plugins |


## Interpreting Results

### Healthy Output

All checks pass — no action needed.

### Common Issues and Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Codex CLI not found | `npm install -g @openai/codex` or install via `codex login` |
| Gemini CLI not found | Install Gemini CLI from Google |
| Antigravity CLI not found | Install `agy`, then verify with `agy --version` and `agy models` |
| Perplexity not configured | `export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="pplx-..."` (optional) |
| Auth expired | Re-run `codex login` or `gemini login` |
| Circuit breaker OPEN | Provider had 3+ consecutive transient failures — wait for cooldown or check provider status |
| Stale state | Delete `.octo/state.json` and re-initialize |
| Invalid hooks.json | Check `hooks.json` syntax — must be valid JSON |
| RTK not installed | Offer to install: `brew install rtk && rtk init -g` (saves 60-90% tokens). Use AskUserQuestion to offer brew vs cargo install. |
| RTK installed but hook not configured | On macOS/Linux, offer `rtk init -g`; on Windows Git Bash, report skipped because RTK uses CLAUDE.md injection mode |
| RTK gain stats unavailable | Run some bash commands first, then check `rtk gain` to see token savings |
| Conflicting plugins | Uninstall conflicting plugins or adjust scope |


## Integration with Other Skills

| Scenario | Route |
|----------|-------|
| Doctor finds missing provider | Suggest `/octo:setup` to configure |
| Doctor finds stale project state | Suggest `/octo:status` to review |
| Doctor finds hook errors | Guide user to fix hooks.json |
| All checks pass, user still has issues | Suggest `/octo:debug` for deeper investigation |


## Hook Profile

Claude Octopus hooks can run in different profiles to balance cost and coverage.

Current profile: `$OCTO_HOOK_PROFILE` (default: standard)

Available profiles:
- **minimal** — Only session lifecycle and cost tracking hooks (lowest overhead)
- **standard** — All hooks except expensive review/security gates (default)
- **strict** — All hooks enabled including quality and security gates

Override: Set `OCTO_PROFILE=budget|balanced|quality` or `OCTO_DISABLED_HOOKS=hook1,hook2` to fine-tune. Legacy `OCTO_HOOK_PROFILE` still works (minimal→budget, standard→balanced, strict→quality).


## Intensity Profile

The doctor reports the active intensity profile — a single knob controlling hook gating, model selection, phase skipping, and context verbosity.

### What the Doctor Checks

- **Current profile**: `OCTO_PROFILE` value (budget/balanced/quality, default: balanced)
- **Profile source**: env var, legacy `OCTO_HOOK_PROFILE`, or auto-selected from intent
- **Hook gating**: which hooks are enabled/disabled at this profile level
- **Model hints**: which model (sonnet/opus) is recommended for each phase
- **Context verbosity**: compressed/standard/full

### Profile Summary

| Dimension | budget | balanced | quality |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Hooks | essential only | standard (no quality gates) | all hooks |
| Models | Sonnet everywhere | Sonnet + Opus for synthesis | Opus for most phases |
| Phases | Skip discover if context given | Skip re-discovery | All phases run |
| Context | Compressed | Standard | Full inlining |


## Project Tier Hint

Also report `OCTO_TIER` when set. This is a recommendation hint, not a hard policy.

| Tier | Doctor guidance |
|------|-----------------|
| `prototype` | Prefer faster checks and warn before high-cost provider fanout |
| `mvp` | Use balanced defaults and consensus on risky changes |
| `production` | Recommend full verification, security review, and stricter release gates |

If unset, show `OCTO_TIER=unset` and suggest setting it only when the project has a stable risk profile.


## Remote Session Checks

If `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` or `OCTOPUS_REMOTE_SESSION=true`, report:

- remote session detected
- autonomous mode default active when no explicit autonomy is set
- provider probes skipped to conserve time/quota
- full HUD disabled unless `OCTOPUS_REMOTE_STATUSLINE=full`
- provider CLIs may need to be installed in the cloud setup script

Suggest `/octo:setup` only for configuration guidance; do not recommend interactive provider logins inside the remote session.


## Runtime Context

The doctor checks for project-level `RUNTIME.md` — a file that provides project-specific context (API endpoints, env vars, test commands, build steps) to orchestration prompts.

### What the Doctor Checks

- **RUNTIME.md exists** in the project root (also checks `.octopus/RUNTIME.md` and `.claude-octopus/RUNTIME.md`)
- If missing, suggest creating one from the template: `cp "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/config/templates/RUNTIME.md" ./RUNTIME.md`
- If present, confirm it contains at least one populated section (not just the template defaults)

### Why It Matters

Without a `RUNTIME.md`, orchestration prompts lack project-specific details — leading to generic advice about test commands, environment variables, and build steps. A populated `RUNTIME.md` makes every workflow more accurate.


## Quick Reference

`/octo:doctor` was removed in v9.41.0 to preserve Claude Code's native `/doctor` command.
Invoke this skill by asking Claude naturally, or run the orchestrator directly:

| What to say / run | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| "run Octopus doctor diagnostics" | Run all 11 categories |
| "check Octopus providers" | Check provider installation only |
| `bash scripts/orchestrate.sh doctor auth --verbose` | Detailed auth status |
| `bash scripts/orchestrate.sh doctor --json` | Machine-readable output |
