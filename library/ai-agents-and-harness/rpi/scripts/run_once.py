# The exact-identity property is BYTE-addressed: Validate snapshots the resolved
# intent bytes under `sha256(bytes)` and stores them as `<digest>.intent`
# (validate.py snapshot_intent), then re-derives that same digest from the same
# bytes when it binds runtime facts into the verdict. RPI is a dispatcher, not a
# second digest authority — it carries the digest Plan declares over the bytes it
# snapshotted, and cross-checks Validate's independently re-derived value against
# it.
#
# This module previously computed its own `sha256(canonical-JSON(mapping))` here
# and hard-compared that against Validate's `sha256(raw bytes)`. The two can
# never agree unless the source is byte-identical canonical JSON, so the composed
# contract was broken; both unit suites stayed green only because the RPI test
# mocked Validate with THIS module's digest function. A canonical-JSON digest is
# also the wrong identity in principle: two different source files that parse to
# the same mapping share it, which is precisely the collision exact identity
# exists to forbid.
