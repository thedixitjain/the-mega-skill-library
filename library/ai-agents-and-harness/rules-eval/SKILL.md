# Rules Evaluation Framework

## When NOT To Use

- Evaluating skills (use `abstract:skills-eval`)
- Evaluating hooks (use `abstract:hooks-eval`)
- Writing a new rule (use `hookify:writing-rules`)

## Overview

This skill evaluates Claude Code rules in `.claude/rules/` directories against quality standards. It validates YAML frontmatter, glob pattern syntax, content quality, and directory organization. Rules files support path-scoped conditional loading via `paths` frontmatter and unconditional rules (no `paths` field).

Key validations: YAML syntax errors, unquoted glob patterns, Cursor-specific fields (`alwaysApply`, `globs`), overly broad patterns, content verbosity, and naming conventions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Evaluate rules in current project
/rules-eval

# Evaluate specific directory
/rules-eval .claude/rules/

# Detailed analysis with recommendations
/rules-eval --detailed
```

## Evaluation Workflow

1. Scan `.claude/rules/` for all `.md` files (including subdirectories)
2. Validate YAML frontmatter syntax and fields
3. Analyze glob patterns for correctness and specificity
4. Assess content quality (actionable, concise, non-conflicting)
5. Check organization (naming, structure, symlinks)
6. Measure token efficiency and redundancy

## Scoring

| Category | Points | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Frontmatter Validity | 25 | YAML syntax, required fields, correct field names |
| Glob Pattern Quality | 20 | Syntax, specificity, quoting |
| Content Quality | 25 | Actionable, concise, non-conflicting |
| Organization | 15 | Naming, structure, symlink usage |
| Token Efficiency | 15 | Rule size, redundancy detection |

| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 91-100 | Excellent - Production-ready |
| 76-90 | Good - Minor improvements possible |
| 51-75 | Basic - Needs optimization |
| 26-50 | Below Standards - Significant issues |
| 0-25 | Critical - Invalid or broken rules |

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Every `.md` file under `.claude/rules/` (including subdirectories) receives a quality score
  (0-100) with per-category breakdown across the five dimensions.
- [ ] YAML frontmatter syntax errors and unquoted glob patterns are listed as blocking findings
  before any score is reported.
- [ ] Rules using Cursor-specific fields (`alwaysApply`, `globs`) are flagged as
  non-compliant with the expected Claude Code schema.
- [ ] Any rule scoring below 26 (Critical tier) is reported with at least one concrete
  corrective action, not just a score.
