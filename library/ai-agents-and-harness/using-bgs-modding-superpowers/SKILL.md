# Using BGS Modding Superpowers

You are operating with the `bgs-modding-superpowers` plugin loaded. This plugin
gives you an agent-driven toolkit for Bethesda Game Studio modpack curation:
MO2 control plane, xEdit MCP, conflict-audit workflow, and runtime asset skills
for dev-log and release-changelog maintenance.

## Available skills (auto-trigger on these intents)

| Skill | Auto-triggers when |
|---|---|
| `setting-up-bgs-modding-environment` | First conversation in a project; MO2 or xEdit not yet detected; user says "set up", "install", "bootstrap", "configure" |
| `maintaining-modding-environments` | After first-run: "ongoing", "maintain", "register custom pack", "prune cache", "update knowledge base", "modding environment health check" |
| `evaluating-bgs-mods` | Deciding whether a mod belongs in the pack; "should I add this mod", "is this mod good", "评估这个mod", "这个mod值得装吗", "this mod looks too good to be true" |
| `interpreting-mod-author-instructions` | After INCLUDE verdict, before download/install; "how do I install", "FOMOD choices", "which file to download", "author说明", "which variant", "按作者说明安装" |
| `curating-bgs-modpack` | Whole-pack incremental build strategy; "plan the pack", "batch strategy", "rollback point", "naming convention", "declare 风格", "策展整合包", "整合包规划" |
| `diagnosing-bgs-problems` | It broke — symptom-first triage; "CTD", "crash log", "FPS drop", "stuttering", "Buffout", "freeze", "won't start", "崩溃", "掉帧", "卡顿" |
| `testing-bgs-modpack` | Proactive post-install verification of a batch; "test the pack", "verification", "post-install check", "is it stable", "what should I test", "测试整合包", "验证安装" |
| `xedit-automation` | Any task involving `.esp/.esm/.esl` plugin files, FormIDs, masters, conflicts, ESL flagging, ITM/UDR cleaning, Pascal scripts |
| `xedit-conflict-audit` | "Why is this override not winning?", "Which plugins overlap on this record?", "Is this load order safe?" |
| `writing-bgs-load-order` | Reading/editing/generating `plugins.txt` or `loadorder.txt`; enabling/disabling/reordering/adding/removing plugins; launching xEdit with a custom plugins file; "load order", "enable this plugin", "disable that plugin", "what does the asterisk mean" |
| `using-bgs-translator` | Translate a Bethesda plugin's text to another language; "translate this mod", "汉化这个 mod", "localize mod to chinese", "build SST for", "use my LLM to translate plugins" |
| `using-bgs-archive` | unpack/pack BA2/BSA archives; inspect archive format/contents; extract assets |
| `using-bgs-papyrus` | compile/decompile Papyrus PSC<->PEX for Skyrim/FO4/Starfield |
| `writing-modpack-devlog` | "Log this", "record what I did", "note this change", "add to dev-log", "track this decision" |
| `writing-modpack-changelog` | "Cut a release", "release notes", "what changed since v1.2", "prepare release for Nexus" |

When the user's intent matches one of these, invoke the corresponding skill
through your skill tool BEFORE replying. Do not paraphrase the skill from memory;
let the skill load.

## Available MCP tools

The bundled `xedit` MCP server (declared in `.mcp.json` for Claude Code / Codex,
declared via the OpenCode plugin's `config.mcp.xedit` hook) is fully
**non-blocking**: every tool returns immediately. The xEdit daemon's lifecycle
is tracked in the server's in-memory state machine, and domain tools fast-fail
with `code: "not_ready"` if you call them before the daemon is ready.

### Lifecycle / health tools (3) — always non-blocking

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `xedit_status` | Pure read. Returns `{ status: "not_started" \| "starting" \| "ready" \| "failed", ... }`. Never modifies state. Use this to POLL while waiting for a launch. |
| `xedit_start` | Kicks off an asynchronous daemon launch if not already starting/ready. Returns immediately. Accepts optional overrides: `{ launcherPath?, gameMode?, dataPath?, pluginsFile?, moProfile? }`. Use `dataPath` (MO2 `gamePath + "\\Data"`) to override xEdit's registry-discovered platform path; use `pluginsFile` to point at a custom load order (see `writing-bgs-load-order`). The launch itself takes 60-240s; that work happens in the background. |
| `xedit_health` | When ready: sends `system.ping` through the named pipe to catch zombies. Returns `responsive: true \| false`. Otherwise: returns the same shape as `xedit_status`. |
| `xedit_dirty` | Returns xEdit's dirty state immediately. When ready: wraps `session.get_dirty_state` and returns `{ dirty, dirtyFiles, unsavedChangeCount }`. Otherwise: returns the same shape as `xedit_status`. |
| `xedit_stop` | Stops the daemon and clears MCP runtime state. If there are unsaved edits, it refuses unless `force: true` is passed. |
| `xedit_restart` | Stops the daemon (same dirty-state safety as `xedit_stop`) and immediately kicks off a fresh async launch. Use this to relaunch with a new `pluginsFile` or `dataPath` instead of reconnecting `/mcp` manually. |

### Domain tools (6) — require ready, fast-fail otherwise

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `xedit_session` | If ready: returns the full session envelope (gameMode, loadOrderSize, daemonPid). If not_started: auto-initiates the launch. Otherwise: returns the current status. Always non-blocking. |
| `xedit_list_capabilities` | Curated 49-command digest + live drift report. |
| `xedit_find_record` | Locate by `{file, formId}` or `{editorId}`. |
| `xedit_read_record` | Fields + base record + winning override. |
| `xedit_inspect_conflicts` | W2 verdict tool: `no_conflict / itpo / itm / minor / breaking`. |
| `xedit_call(command, args)` | Atomic passthrough for any of the 49 native daemon commands; in-harness. |

### Canonical lifecycle pattern (do this every session that touches xEdit)

```
1. xedit_start({})                  -> { status: "starting" }      (or "ready")
2. xedit_status({})                 -> poll until status="ready"   (sleep 5-15s between calls)
3. xedit_health({})                 -> confirm responsive=true
4. xedit_session({}) / xedit_*      -> normal domain work
5. xedit_dirty({})                  -> check unsaved changes before any stop/restart
6. xedit_stop({ force?: true })     -> stop + clear runtime state
7. xedit_restart({ ..., force? })   -> relaunch with new overrides
```

NEVER call a domain tool in a tight loop expecting it to "wait." If
`xedit_status` reports `status: "failed"`, surface `data.error` to the user and
stop — common causes are MO2 not running visibly, the Python plugin not loaded,
the xEdit binary missing, or xEdit's automation-serve tripping on the active
load order.

The structured daemon-command and workflow reference now lives in KB records.
Use `bgs_kb_query` / `bgs_kb_get` for deep reference retrieval; the old
`skills/xedit-automation/xedit-knowledgebase.md` path is a redirect only.

### BGS knowledge-base tools (3) — curated knowledge, no xEdit daemon

The sibling BGS knowledge-base MCP is for curated modding knowledge, not live
runtime state. It works before MO2 / xEdit are configured; use xEdit MCP for
actual plugin, load-order, and record readback.

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `bgs_kb_status` | Reports loaded KB packs, versions, games, domains, cache root, and user pack roots. |
| `bgs_kb_query` | Searches loaded packs for ranked knowledge snippets with game/domain filters and sources. |
| `bgs_kb_get` | Fetches a full record by id, merging game-specific variants when `game` is provided. |

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

1. **The user's `<MO2_Root>` and any `<MO2_Root>/<game>/Data/` (or equivalent
   "Stock Game" tree) is real game state.** Never write into it directly. Any
   game-local change is expressed as an MO2 mod overlay under
   `<MO2_Root>/mods/<mod-name>/`. The MO2 VFS projects it at runtime.
2. **All xEdit work goes through the bundled `xedit` MCP.** Never spawn
   `xEdit.exe` directly from the shell, never parse `.esp/.esm/.esl` files with
   your own Python/JS, never invoke `xedit-client.ps1` from raw shell. The MCP
   exists so the harness can enforce validation, state, rules, and audit on
   every call. Atomic passthrough (`xedit_call`) is the documented escape hatch
   when an intent tool does not fit — it is still in-harness.
3. **Mutating operations require explicit user consent and a daemon launched
   with `-IKnowWhatImDoing`.** Read the `xedit-automation` skill BEFORE any
   destructive work. The anti-pattern list there is binding.
4. **A `session.save` response is not durability.** A save with
   `savedFilesPendingShutdown > 0` is deferred. Durability proof =
   save + daemon restart (new PID) + readback. Always restart before declaring
   a mutating workflow complete.
5. **Large scope (many records, broad conflict survey) → delegate to a
   read-only investigator subagent FIRST.** The subagent burns its own context
   and returns a distilled summary. Do not loop hundreds of records through
   your own context.
6. **BGS domain knowledge routes through the KB first.** For questions about
   how BGS modding works — Papyrus semantics, plugin-format gotchas, archive
   precedence, load-order conventions, common engine quirks, or game-specific
   toolchain gotchas — call `bgs_kb_status` / `bgs_kb_query` before
   improvising or reaching for web search. If the question is about what the
   current local load order, plugin, or record actually is, use `xedit_*` or the
   relevant file/CLI surface instead. The KB is advisory; xEdit readback remains
   authoritative for actual state. If `bgs_kb_status` reports no packs or the
   needed game pack is missing, fall back to web research using the roadmap
   Appendix source list or route setup/maintenance work to install the pack.
7. **First-run state**: if MO2 / xEdit / the control-plane Python plugin are
   not yet set up on this machine, invoke `setting-up-bgs-modding-environment`
   BEFORE any modpack work. That skill orchestrates detection and install.
8. **Nexus credentials and Premium download paths**: MO2 stores the user's
   Nexus API key globally in Windows Credential Manager under target
   `ModOrganizer2_APIKEY` (legacy) / `ModOrganizer2_NEXUS_OAUTH_TOKENS`
   (modern OAuth). Reading the key requires explicit per-session user consent
   and the key must be masked in any visible output. The agent-friendly
   refresh path for Nexus update state is "Option B" — direct API call to
   `/v1/games/{game}/mods/{id}.json` + write back to `meta.ini` via
   `mo2_edit_meta`, no MO2 GUI launch needed. Both workflows are documented in
   the `maintaining-modding-environments` skill and in KB records
   `install-planning.mo2-windows-credential-mining.v1` +
   `install-planning.nexus-direct-api-update-check.v1`. For Premium-account
   direct downloads, use `POST /v1/games/{game}/mods/{id}/files/{file_id}/download_link.json`
   (returns 7 CDN mirrors) — Premium-only; free accounts must use the Nexus
   browser flow.

## How to use this bootstrap

- This skill loads automatically on every new session. You do not need to
  re-invoke it.
- When a user intent matches a task skill in the table above, invoke that skill
  via your skill tool. Do not paraphrase.
- When the user asks about "what can you do", reference the skills inventory
  here; do not invent capabilities the plugin does not have.
- When answering BGS modding-domain questions, prefer local KB retrieval before
  web search. The bundled core pack ships inline; per-game packs may be
  installed later via setup / maintenance skills; end-user packs may be
  registered via `$BGS_KB_USER_PACKS` through `maintaining-modding-environments`.
- When you would normally write code that touches BGS plugin files (`.esp/.esm/
  .esl`), STOP and route through `xedit-automation` instead.
- When the user is deciding whether to add or keep a mod ("should I install X",
  "is this good", "评估"), route to `evaluating-bgs-mods` BEFORE any
  install/download action.
- When an INCLUDE verdict is in and the user needs to read author instructions /
  pick FOMOD options / choose a file or variant, route to
  `interpreting-mod-author-instructions`.
- When the user is planning the whole pack, sizing batches, deciding rollback
  boundaries, or declaring 风格, route to `curating-bgs-modpack`.
- When the user reports a crash, CTD, FPS drop, freeze, or stutter ("崩溃",
  "掉帧", "卡顿"), route to `diagnosing-bgs-problems` for symptom-first triage
  BEFORE any blame attribution.
- When the user wants to verify a freshly installed batch ("test the pack",
  "is it stable", "验证安装"), route to `testing-bgs-modpack`.
- When the user wants to translate plugin text or emit SST dictionaries for a
  mod, route to `using-bgs-translator` instead of xEdit; translator reads plugin
  text and emits dictionaries, it does not modify plugin binaries.
- When the user wants to inspect, unpack, extract, or pack BA2/BSA archives,
  route to `using-bgs-archive`; archive packing must write to MO2 overlays, not
  game `Data` or Stock-Game trees.
- When the user wants to compile or decompile Papyrus scripts (`.psc` / `.pex`),
  route to `using-bgs-papyrus`; compiled `.pex` output must go to MO2 overlays,
  not game `Data` or Stock-Game trees.
- When the user asks to "log", "record", "track", or "note" modpack work,
  route to `writing-modpack-devlog`. When the user asks to "cut a release" or
  prepare release notes, route to `writing-modpack-changelog`.
