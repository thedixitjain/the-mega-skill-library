# Session End Skill

> **Platform Note:** State files (STATE.md, wave-scope.json) live in the platform's native directory: `.claude/` (Claude Code), `.codex/` (Codex CLI), `.cursor/` (Cursor IDE), or `.pi/` (Pi). All references to `.claude/` below should use the platform's state directory. Shared metrics live in `.orchestrator/metrics/`. See `skills/_shared/platform-tools.md`.

> **Project-instruction file:** `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI) are transparent aliases — see [skills/_shared/instruction-file-resolution.md](../_shared/instruction-file-resolution.md). All references to `CLAUDE.md` in this skill resolve via that precedence rule.

## Phase 0: Bootstrap Gate

Read `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` and execute the gate check. If the gate is CLOSED, invoke `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` and wait for completion before proceeding. If the gate is OPEN, continue to Phase 1.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed past Phase 0 if GATE_CLOSED. There is no bypass. Refer to `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` for the full HARD-GATE constraints.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase 0.5: Parallel-Aware Preamble

> Skip silently when `persistence: false` in Session Config.

Before Phase 1, run the parallel-aware preamble per `skills/_shared/parallel-aware-preamble.md`. The preamble detects other active sessions in the worktree-family via `findPeers(repoRoot, { mySessionId })`, classifies the caller's mode via `classifyMode(callerMode)` against the exclusivity-matrix, and fires the appropriate AUQ on conflict.

**Outcome handling:**
- `PASS_THROUGH` → continue to Phase 1
- `EXCLUSIVE_BLOCKED` → exit Phase 0 cleanly per the AUQ outcome
- `PROMOTION_OFFER` → user picks Worktree-Promotion (see `parallel-aware-auq.md` outcome-handling — calls `enterWorktree()`), in-place + Deviation, or Abbrechen

For session-end specifically: the preamble is DETECTION-ONLY. The lock-release path in later phases keeps its current behavior — releasing the OWN session's lock requires no matrix consultation.

**Implementation reference:** `skills/_shared/parallel-aware-preamble.md § Implementation`.
**AUQ reference:** `skills/_shared/parallel-aware-auq.md`.

## Phase 0.6: Skill-Invocation Self-Report (#724, C4)

> Emit an L1 skill-invocation record for `session-end` itself. The PreToolUse `Skill`-matcher hook only captures skills dispatched via the `Skill` tool — a **prose-invoked** skill like this one is invisible to it (verified gap: zero `session-end` rows in `skill-invocations.jsonl` despite many closed sessions). This self-report closes that gap so L2/L3 skill-health has a `session-end` selection signal. Best-effort, try/catch-silent — it never blocks the close.

```javascript
try {
  const { appendSkillInvocation, DEFAULT_SKILL_INVOCATIONS_PATH } =
    await import('${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/skill-invocations-schema.mjs');
  const nodePath = await import('node:path');
  await appendSkillInvocation(nodePath.join(process.cwd(), DEFAULT_SKILL_INVOCATIONS_PATH), {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    event: 'selected',
    skill: 'session-orchestrator:session-end',
    session_id: sessionId ?? null,   // from session.lock `session_id`, when available
    phase: null,
  });
} catch { /* self-report is advisory — never block the close */ }
```

## Phase 1: Plan Verification

Read back the session plan that was agreed at the start. For EACH planned item:

### 1.1 Done Items
- **Verify with evidence**: read the changed files, check git diff, run relevant test
- Confirm acceptance criteria are met
- Mark as completed

### 1.2 Partially Done Items
- Document what was completed and what remains
- **Do NOT file the carryover issue here (#769).** Collect a carryover **candidate** instead — append it to the in-memory candidate list that the Phase 1.65 Handover Alignment Gate consumes. The issue is filed (only if the gate confirms it) in Phase 5 Step 3. Candidate record (JS keys as `routeCandidates` / `normalizeCandidate` read them — `source-phase`→`sourcePhase`, `origin-issue`→`originIssue`; see `plan-verification.md § Candidate Record Format`):
  - `{ task: '<original task description>', sourcePhase: '1.2', originIssue: <IID or null>, priority: '<original>', bucket: 'partially-done' }`
- The eventual issue keeps the source-specific `[Carryover]` template — Title `[Carryover] <original task description>`, Labels `priority::<original>` + `status:ready`, Description = what's done / what's left / context for next session.
- Link to the original issue when applicable (record its IID as `originIssue`; a candidate with no origin issue auto-carries per the gate's routing, so nothing planned is silently forgotten).

### 1.3 Not Started Items
- Document WHY (blocked? de-scoped? out of time?)
- If no longer relevant: close the original issue with a comment explaining why. This is a **pre-gate disposition** — it files nothing and adds no candidate.
- If still relevant: **do NOT touch the original issue here.** Append a carryover candidate so the Phase 1.65 gate surfaces it — `{ task: '<item>', sourcePhase: '1.3', originIssue: <original IID>, priority: '<original>', bucket: 'not-started' }`. Phase 1.3 files no NEW `[Carryover]` issue; the candidate's disposition IS the keep-vs-carry decision on the ORIGINAL issue. If the gate carries it → ensure the original remains `status:ready`; a dropped middle-band 1.3 candidate leaves the original issue unchanged and open (no auto-close in v1).

### 1.3a Optional /goal Backlog-Drain (opt-in — #636)

> Advisory-only continuation anchor at the session-end backlog seam. Never auto-invokes `/goal`, never blocks the close. `/goal` is a user slash-command; the operator decides whether to drain now or carry over.

**Gate conditions** — ALL must be true for this nudge to surface:

1. `goal-integration.enabled: true` in Session Config (default: `false`).
2. `session-end-backlog` is listed in `goal-integration.seams`.

When any gate condition is false, skip this step silently — no surfaced suggestion, no STATE.md write, no AUQ.

**What it does** — when the gate fires AND ≥1 still-relevant Not-Started (§1.3) or Partially-Done (§1.2) item exists AND the operator would rather drain the backlog now than carry it to a future session, surface ONE suggested `/goal` command as an advisory bullet. Example:

```
/goal Drain the remaining backlog items <list>; done when each item's acceptance check passes as shown by 'npm test' output in this turn AND 'npm run typecheck' prints 0 errors in this turn, or stop after 20 turns.
```

**Advisory-only contract:** this step never auto-invokes `/goal`, never blocks the close, raises no AskUserQuestion, and writes nothing to STATE.md. It is informational prose only — the operator copies the command if they want it. The deterministic **Phase 2 Quality Gate** of session-end remains the completion authority: `/goal` keeps the loop alive across turns, but `npm test` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` and their exit codes decide whether the drained work is correct.

The `/goal` evaluator reads the transcript only and runs NO tools — it anchors CONTINUATION, never JUDGMENT. The suggested condition therefore references freshly-run gate output "in this turn's output" and embeds a bound ("or stop after N turns"). Cross-reference `.claude/rules/loop-and-monitor.md § LM-008` for the full `/goal` continuation-vs-judgment contract rather than restating it here.

**One goal per session:** only ONE `/goal` can be active at a time. This backlog seam and the inter-wave fix-loop seam (`wave-loop.md` § /goal Continuation Anchor) cannot both hold an active goal simultaneously — the operator picks one.

### 1.4 Emergent Work
- Tasks that were NOT in the plan but were done (fixes, discoveries)
- **Completed emergent work** (finished, or already dispositioned into an issue): document and attribute to the relevant issues exactly as today — this path is **NOT gated**. If a completed emergent fix warrants a follow-up/doc issue, create it immediately (unchanged behavior).
- **Unfinished / undispositioned emergent work** (at close, neither finished nor already filed as an issue): **do NOT file it here.** Append a carryover candidate — `{ task: '<emergent item>', sourcePhase: '1.4', originIssue: <IID or null>, priority: '<assessed>', bucket: 'emergent' }`. The Phase 1.65 gate decides whether it is filed; a confirmed 1.4 candidate is filed in Phase 5 Step 3 as a **normal** issue (NOT the `[Carryover]` template).

### 1.5 Discovery Scan (if enabled)

Read `skills/session-end/discovery-scan.md` for embedded discovery dispatch and findings triage.

### 1.6 Safety Review

> Skip if `persistence` is `false` in Session Config (STATE.md won't exist).

Review safety metrics from the session. This is informational — it does NOT block the session close.

1. Read `<state-dir>/STATE.md` to extract:
   - **Circuit breaker activations**: agents that hit maxTurns (`PARTIAL`), agents that spiraled (`SPIRAL`), agents that failed (`FAILED`)
   - **Worktree status**: which agents used worktree isolation, any fallbacks or merge conflicts
2. Read enforcement hook logs from stderr (if captured): count of scope violations blocked/warned, command violations blocked/warned
3. Summarize:
   ```
   Safety review:
   - Agents: [X] complete, [Y] partial (hit turn limit), [Z] spiral/failed
   - Enforcement: [N] scope violations, [M] command blocks
   - Isolation: [K] agents in worktrees, [J] fallbacks
   ```
4. If any agents were `SPIRAL` or `FAILED`, ensure a carryover **candidate** is collected for each (they auto-carry; filed via the Phase 1.65 gate → Phase 5 Step 3 — cross-reference with Phase 1.2)

5. **Carryover validation fallback (#261) — collect, do NOT file yet (#769):** Walk each Wave History entry in STATE.md. For every agent whose status is `SPIRAL` or `FAILED`, check whether the line ends with a `→ issue #NNN` suffix (or `→ existing #NNN`). If the suffix is absent, the auto-create call in wave-executor did not run (e.g. a consumer-project #251 V0.x.y-close incident where the session crashed before dispatch completed, or the CLI was offline at detection time). **Do NOT call `createSpiralCarryoverIssue` here** — since #769 its firing moves behind the Phase 1.65 Handover Alignment Gate so that NO `[Carryover]` issue is created before the gate. Instead append an **auto-carry** candidate (SPIRAL/FAILED is a non-deselectable auto-carry class — the gate only surfaces it in the status count, never as a deselectable option; consistent with the Critical Rule at `SKILL.md:853`), carrying the payload the deferred `createSpiralCarryoverIssue` call will need:

   ```js
   // #769: collect, don't file. The actual createSpiralCarryoverIssue() call
   // fires in Phase 5 Step 3 (behind the gate). bucket 'spiral-failed' → auto-carry,
   // so it is ALWAYS carried; the operator never sees it as a triage option.
   // For each SPIRAL/FAILED agent missing the "→ issue #NNN" suffix:
   candidates.push({
     task: '<agent task from Wave History>',
     sourcePhase: '1.6',
     originIssue: null,           // SPIRAL/FAILED safety-net items carry no origin issue
     priority: 'high',
     bucket: 'spiral-failed',
     // Filing payload retained on the coordinator's original candidate object,
     // consumed in Phase 5 Step 3 (routeCandidates only classifies — it returns
     // normalized copies and does not carry this annotation):
     _spiral: { kind: 'SPIRAL' /* or 'FAILED' */, context: '<Deviations / error context from STATE.md>' },
   });
   ```

   The deferred Phase-5.3 call imports `createSpiralCarryoverIssue` from `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/spiral-carryover.mjs`; it is idempotent via its task-hash dedup marker, so re-running the fallback across sessions will not create duplicates.

#### 1.6.6 Record "What Not To Retry" entries (#623)

> Skip if `persistence` is `false` (STATE.md won't exist).

For every `SPIRAL` or `FAILED` agent surfaced in the walk above, ALSO append a cross-session "What Not To Retry" entry to STATE.md. This is the durable, human-readable continuity slot that the NEXT session-start surfaces as a forced-read block (session-start Phase 6.5.1) so a future session does not re-attempt the same failed approach. Unlike a carryover issue (which captures unfinished work), this captures the *approach that should not be repeated*.

```js
import { appendWhatNotToRetryOnDisk } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/state-md.mjs';

// `parsed` = parseStateMd(STATE.md); session id from the `session:` frontmatter field.
const sessionId = parsed.frontmatter.session ?? 'unknown-session';
const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10); // YYYY-MM-DD

// For each SPIRAL/FAILED agent from the Wave History walk:
await appendWhatNotToRetryOnDisk(repoRoot, {
  approach: '<agent task description from Wave History>',
  why_failed: '<SPIRAL|FAILED> — <one-line context> (evidence: <file:line or path>)',
  session_id: sessionId,
  date: today,
});
```

`why_failed` MUST cite at least one concrete file (and line, if applicable) that grounds the failure — a bare narrative reason without a file reference is not acceptable.

The helper is lock-guarded (PSA-005) and prunes the section FIFO to the 10 most-recent entries on each append. **Optional coordinator entry:** if the session abandoned an approach for reasons NOT captured by a SPIRAL/FAILED agent (e.g. a design that proved unworkable mid-session), the coordinator MAY add a free-text entry through the SAME `appendWhatNotToRetryOnDisk` helper with a descriptive `approach` + `why_failed`. Recording is informational and does NOT block the close.

### 1.65 Handover Alignment Gate (#769)

> **Opt-in-by-default interactive gate.** Reads `handover-gate.enabled` (default `true`) and `handover-gate.max-open-questions` (default `3`) from parsed Session Config (`cfg['handover-gate']`, produced by `scripts/lib/config.mjs` → `scripts/lib/config/handover-gate.mjs`). Position is load-bearing: it runs AFTER Phase 1.6.6 — so all four candidate sources (1.2 Partially Done, 1.3 Not Started still-relevant, 1.4 unfinished Emergent, 1.6 SPIRAL/FAILED walk) are computed and NOTHING has been filed yet — and BEFORE Phase 1.7, so the gate's carry/drop decision feeds the Phase 1.7 carryover count. This is the ONLY place `[Carryover]` filing is authorized to originate; Phase 5 Step 3 merely executes the gate's carry-list.

> **Skill-prose-first, minimal mechanical core** — same pattern as Phase 3.6.3 memory-proposals: the coordinator runs the `AskUserQuestion` interaction (per `.claude/rules/ask-via-tool.md` AUQ-003); the pure `scripts/lib/handover-gate.mjs` lib does only the deterministic classification. No hook, no agent, no new event schema.

#### Fail-open skip (FA5 — the load-bearing safety decision)

Skip the gate entirely — treat EVERY candidate as carry (byte-identical to the pre-#769 status quo), emitting a single stderr WARN — when ANY of:

- `cfg['handover-gate'].enabled === false`.
- session-end runs in an **embedded / autopilot** context OR headless `claude -p` (no operator at the keyboard; `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable per AUQ-004 — the same embedded-mode precedent as discovery suppressing its AUQ).
- `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable or throws at call time (wrap the calls; on error, fail-open — never surface a half-rendered gate).
- The candidate list is empty AND STATE.md `## Open Questions` has no unanswered entry — **Zero-Friction clean close**: emit NO AUQ and continue unchanged.

Fail-open NEVER hangs the close on an unanswerable AUQ and NEVER loses data — it degrades exactly to today's silent-carryover behavior. Log e.g. `⚠ handover-gate: skipped (<reason>) — all candidates carry (status quo)`.

**Telemetry on skip (#773):** even when the gate is skipped, emit the `orchestrator.handover.gated` event ONCE with `path: "fail_open"` so this never-interactive path is still measurable (the carryover=0 blind spot #773 closed was invisible precisely because skipped closes emitted nothing). Every candidate carries, so `auto_carry = candidates_total`, `asked = 0`, `dropped = 0`, and the three question counts are `0`:

```bash
node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.handover.gated --payload \
  "$(node -e "process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({candidates_total: CT, auto_carry: CT, asked: 0, dropped: 0, questions_asked: 0, questions_answered: 0, questions_deferred: 0, path: 'fail_open'}))")"
```

(`CT` = the in-memory candidate-list length. The Zero-Friction clean-close variant — empty candidates AND no open questions — emits with all counts `0` and `path: "fail_open"` too, so even the quietest close leaves a breadcrumb.)

#### Step 1 — Assemble candidates + open questions

1. The in-memory **candidate list** is the union of the candidates appended by Phases 1.2 / 1.3 (still-relevant) / 1.4 (unfinished emergent) / 1.6 (SPIRAL/FAILED). Each candidate object carries `{ task, sourcePhase, originIssue, priority, bucket }` (plus any filing payload, e.g. the SPIRAL/FAILED `_spiral` kind/context). See `plan-verification.md § Candidate Record Format`.

2. **Classify** via the pure helper:

   ```js
   import { routeCandidates } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/handover-gate.mjs';
   const { autoCarry, ask } = routeCandidates(candidates);
   ```

   `autoCarry` = `priority::critical|high` OR `bucket === 'spiral-failed'` OR `originIssue === null` — **non-deselectable** (dropping any of these would be real forgetting; consistent with the Critical Rule at `SKILL.md:853`). `ask` = the middle-band (priority `medium`/`low`/none WITH an origin issue, buckets not-started/emergent/partially-done) plus any `malformed` record. `routeCandidates` returns NORMALIZED copies for gate rendering; the coordinator retains its ORIGINAL candidate objects (with filing payloads) for Phase 5 Step 3.

3. Read STATE.md contents and extract the open questions via the sibling helper:

   ```js
   import { readOpenQuestions } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/state-md.mjs';
   const openQuestions = readOpenQuestions(stateMdContents); // Array<{question, source, priority, answered, answer?}>
   const unanswered = openQuestions.filter((q) => !q.answered);
   ```

4. **Zero-Friction check:** if `autoCarry.length === 0 && ask.length === 0 && unanswered.length === 0`, skip per Fail-open above (no AUQ, no WARN needed beyond an info log — clean close).

#### Step 2 — AUQ Call 1 (Status-Gate)

Render ONE `AskUserQuestion`. The question text NAMES the candidate counts by class and the open-question count, e.g. `"<A> auto-carry + <M> triage candidate(s), <U> open question(s). Close and triage now?"`. Options (Recommendation first, AUQ-003):

- **"Closen + Triage (Recommended)"** — proceed to AUQ Call 2 (triage the middle-band + answer the top open questions), then file the resulting carry-list in Phase 5 Step 3.
- **"Alle carryoven (ohne Triage)"** — fast-path: carry ALL candidates (`autoCarry ∪ ask`) with no triage; SKIP AUQ Call 2; unanswered questions stay `- [ ]` and roundtrip to the next session. Equivalent to the status quo for filing, minus the friction.
- **"Weiterarbeiten (Close abbrechen)"** — abort session-end cleanly: NO commit, NO lock-release, NO issue creation; STATE.md stays `status: active`; the session remains open and the coordinator continues working the open points. **Before stopping, emit `orchestrator.handover.gated` ONCE with `path: "weiterarbeiten"` (#773)** — the gate WAS rendered (AUQ Call 1 happened) and the operator chose to keep working, which is a distinct, previously-unmeasured outcome. Nothing is filed, so report `auto_carry = autoCarry.length`, `asked = ask.length`, `dropped = 0`, and all three question counts `0`:

  ```bash
  node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.handover.gated --payload \
    "$(node -e "process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({candidates_total: CT, auto_carry: AC, asked: ASK, dropped: 0, questions_asked: 0, questions_answered: 0, questions_deferred: 0, path: 'weiterarbeiten'}))")"
  ```

  Then print `session-end aborted at Phase 1.65 by user choice (Weiterarbeiten). Session stays open.` and STOP the close (do not fall through to Phase 1.7).

(Codex CLI / Cursor IDE: same three options as a numbered Markdown list.)

#### Step 3 — AUQ Call 2 (Triage + Open Questions) — only after "Closen + Triage"

Combine the Middle-Band triage multiSelect AND up to `max-open-questions` open-question single-questions, honoring AUQ-003 (≤4 questions/call, ≤4 options/multiSelect):

1. **Middle-Band multiSelect** — one multiSelect over the `ask` candidates, EVERY option **preselected** (= carry; one Enter keeps the sensible default). Option label: `[<bucket>] <task-truncated> — <priority|—> (origin #<IID|none>)`. `multiSelect: true`. Deselected = drop.
   - **Batching (Phase 3.6.3 precedent):** `0` → no multiSelect; `1–4` → a single multiSelect that rides in the SAME first call alongside the open questions; `5+` → sequential `Batch N of M` multiSelects in FIFO batches of 4 (`header: "Handover — Triage Middle-Band (Batch N of M)"`).

     ```js
     const BATCH_SIZE = 4;
     const batches = [];
     for (let i = 0; i < ask.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) batches.push(ask.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE));
     ```

     When `ask.length ≤ 4`: the single triage multiSelect + up to `max-open-questions` open-question single-questions all ride in ONE call (1 + 3 = 4 questions max — AUQ-003-safe). When `ask.length > 4`: emit the open questions in the FIRST call and the middle-band as ⌈M/4⌉ dedicated `Batch N of M` calls.

2. **Open questions** — up to `max-open-questions` (default 3; effectively capped at 3 in the first call = the 4-question limit minus the 1 triage multiSelect) highest-priority `unanswered` questions, each a single-select with 2–4 options (Recommendation first). Derive options from the agent-supplied answer-candidates when present; otherwise offer `Answer: <A> / Answer: <B> / Defer (keep open)`. Questions beyond the cap stay untouched (`- [ ]`) and roundtrip (FA3-Semantik).

#### Step 4 — Apply the gate outcome

1. **carry-list** = `autoCarry` (always) ∪ the middle-band `ask` items the operator LEFT SELECTED. **drop-list** = the middle-band `ask` items the operator DESELECTED. (`"Alle carryoven"` → carry-list = `autoCarry ∪ ask`, drop-list = ∅.) Store both for Phase 5 Step 3 (filing) and Phase 6 (report). NOTHING is filed in this phase.

2. **Answered open questions — decide + enqueue in-memory only; do NOT mark `[x]` yet (#769):** for each open question answered in AUQ Call 2, capture the outcome in an in-memory `answeredQuestions` list — one record per answered question: `{ question, answer, impliesWork: <bool> }`. Do **NOT** call `markOpenQuestionAnsweredOnDisk` in this phase.

   The durable STATE.md `- [x]` write is deliberately deferred to **Phase 5 Step 3** so that it lands on the SAME side of the Quality Gate (Phase 3) as the carryover-issue filing — either a completed close marks the question `[x]` AND files its implied work, or a Quality-Gate abort does neither. Marking `[x]` here (at gate time) would silently forget the answer if the Quality Gate later aborts the close: the now-`[x]` question no longer re-surfaces via `readOpenQuestions().filter(!answered)` on re-close, so any implied work would be dropped ticketless — exactly the silent-forget this feature exists to prevent.

   If the chosen answer **implies NEW work** (`impliesWork: true`), ALSO enqueue it now onto the carry-list as a carry-candidate (`originIssue: null` → auto-carry), carrying the answer as body context, so Phase 5 Step 3 files the issue AND marks the question `[x]` atomically. Pure decisions with no to-do (`impliesWork: false`) carry no candidate; they are recorded only by the Phase 5.3 STATE.md `[x]` mark + the Final Report. Unanswered / over-cap questions stay `- [ ]` and roundtrip to the next session (FA4).

3. The gate's carry/drop split feeds the Phase 1.7 carryover count.

#### Step 5 — Emit gate telemetry (#773)

After the carry/drop split is settled, emit `orchestrator.handover.gated` **exactly once** for the interactive path taken. This is the mechanical producer that makes the gate observable — before #773 the gate decided carry/drop entirely in coordinator prose, so `effectiveness.carryover` had no mechanical anchor and 41/41 records read `carryover: 0` despite real filtering. Derive the payload from the in-memory gate state:

- `candidates_total` = `autoCarry.length + ask.length`
- `auto_carry` = `autoCarry.length` (non-deselectable)
- `asked` = `ask.length` (middle-band candidates surfaced for triage)
- `dropped` = drop-list length (middle-band items the operator DESELECTED; `0` on the `"Alle carryoven"` fast-path since AUQ Call 2 is skipped)
- `questions_asked` / `questions_answered` / `questions_deferred` = the open-question counts from AUQ Call 2 (surfaced / answered / left `- [ ]` and roundtripped). All `0` on the fast-path.
- `path` = `"triage"` (after "Closen + Triage") or `"fast_path"` (after "Alle carryoven ohne Triage")

```bash
node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.handover.gated --payload \
  "$(node -e "process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({candidates_total: CT, auto_carry: AC, asked: ASK, dropped: DROP, questions_asked: QA, questions_answered: QAN, questions_deferred: QD, path: PATH}))")"
```

The `questions_asked / questions_answered / questions_deferred` values here are the SAME three counts recorded as the top-level `open_questions_asked / open_questions_answered / open_questions_deferred` session fields in Phase 1.7 (see `metrics-collection.md`). Emit the event with the exact `scripts/emit-event.mjs --type … --payload …` flag signature (NOT a positional argument — see the CLI header).

### 1.7 Metrics Collection

Read `skills/session-end/metrics-collection.md` for JSONL schema and conditional field rules.

### 1.8 Session Review

Dispatch the session-reviewer agent to verify implementation quality before the quality gate:

> On Codex CLI, dispatch via the `session-reviewer` agent role defined in `.codex-plugin/agents/session-reviewer.toml`.

1. Invoke `subagent_type: "session-orchestrator:session-reviewer"` with:
   - **Scope**: all files changed this session (from `git diff --name-only` against the base branch)
   - **Context**: the session plan (issues, acceptance criteria) and all wave results from STATE.md
2. Wait for the reviewer's **Verdict**:
   - **PROCEED** — continue to Phase 2
   - **FIX REQUIRED** — disposition each listed item by severity:

     | Finding class | Disposition |
     |---|---|
     | HIGH+ / blocking review finding | Fix inline if quick (<2 min); else create an issue (`priority::high`, `status:ready`) and note it in the Final Report |
     | MED / LOW review finding | Fold in-session if quick; else record under "Unresolved Review Findings" in the Final Report — DO NOT create an issue (#617) |
     | Planned-carryover (item was in the plan, not finished) | Route as a carryover **candidate** per Phase 1.2 → the Phase 1.65 gate files it. Never forgotten: a no-origin/critical/high item auto-carries as a `[Carryover]` issue; a middle-band item with an origin issue is preselected=carry (and its origin issue stays open even if dropped). |
     | SPIRAL / FAILED agent carryover | Route as an **auto-carry** candidate per Phase 1.6 → filed via `createSpiralCarryoverIssue` in Phase 5 Step 3 (non-deselectable; **exempt from the `issue-budget` cap** — the `[Carryover] [SPIRAL\|FAILED]` title and the `type::carryover` label bypass it, so a full budget can never swallow this filing) |

**Override-ratio telemetry (#730/H5):** whenever one or more MED/LOW review findings are routed to "Unresolved Review Findings" (rather than fixed), additionally emit a single event capturing how many findings were absorbed rather than resolved — feeding the `override_ratio` metric:

```bash
node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.finding.overridden --payload '{"phase":"1.8","kind":"med-low-review-finding","count":N}'
```

### 1.9 Mission-Status Classification (when `mission-status` present in STATE.md)

> Skip if `persistence` is `false` in Session Config, or if `mission-status:` is absent from STATE.md frontmatter. When absent, fall back to binary checkbox detection in 1.1–1.4 unchanged — full backward compat.

When STATE.md frontmatter contains a `mission-status:` array (set by session-plan + wave-executor per #340), use the enum values to classify items into the 1.1–1.4 buckets. Read the array via `parseMissionStatus(frontmatter)` from `scripts/lib/state-md.mjs`.

**Classification mapping:**
- `status: completed` → **1.1 Done Items** (item finished; verify with evidence per 1.1)
- `status: testing` or `status: in-dev` → **1.2 Partially Done** (carryover; document what remains)
- `status: validated` or `status: brainstormed` → **1.3 Not Started** (carryover; check if still relevant)
- Items NOT present in the `mission-status:` array → fall back to binary checkbox detection per 1.1–1.4 unchanged

**Backward compat:** When `mission-status:` is absent from STATE.md (pre-#340 STATE.md files, or sessions where session-plan did not emit the block), behave exactly as before — enum classification is skipped entirely and 1.1–1.4 binary checkbox logic runs as the sole classification mechanism.

### 1.10 Mission Status Breakdown (when `mission-status` present)

> Skip if `mission-status:` is absent from STATE.md frontmatter (backward compat — no breakdown emitted).

After classifying items in Phase 1.9, produce a **Mission Status breakdown** subsection as part of the closed/carryover summary output. Count the number of tasks at each enum value across ALL waves:

```
### Mission Status Breakdown
- completed:    <N> tasks
- testing:      <N> tasks
- in-dev:       <N> tasks
- validated:    <N> tasks
- brainstormed: <N> tasks
- Total:        <N> tasks across <W> waves
```

Rules:
- Count each task-id entry from the `mission-status:` frontmatter array by its current `status` value.
- `completed` maps to Phase 1.1 (Done). `testing` + `in-dev` map to Phase 1.2 (Partial). `validated` + `brainstormed` map to Phase 1.3 (Not Started).
- Include this block in the Phase 6 Final Report under `### Carried Over` or as a standalone subsection immediately after the Completed/Carried Over/New Issues lists.
- When all tasks are `completed`, the breakdown still appears (confirms clean session state).

## Phase 2: Quality Gate

> **Verification Reference:** See `verification-checklist.md` in this skill directory for the full quality gate checklist.

Run ALL checks listed in the verification checklist. If any check fails: fix if quick (<2 min), otherwise create a `priority::high` issue. Do NOT commit broken code.

### Phase 2.0a: Echo-Stub Detection (GH #42)

`gate-full.mjs` emits a top-level `stubbed: {}` map in its JSON result, keyed by check name (`typecheck`, `test`, `lint`); value is `{ kind: 'echo'|'noop' }`. When any check was short-circuited as a stub, `runCheck()` already returned `status: 'pass'` — so the overall gate verdict is green, but the result is meaningless.

**Detection:** immediately after parsing the `gate-full` JSON result, evaluate:

```js
const stubbedEntries = Object.entries(result.stubbed ?? {});
```

**If `stubbedEntries.length > 0`**, surface a HIGH WARN block in the close summary:

```
⚠ QUALITY GATE STUBBED — <N> command(s) are echo/noop stubs, not real checks:
  - <check-name>: <kind> stub  (configured: "<command string>")
Re-configure with a real test command in CLAUDE.md Session Config before /close,
OR document this exception in /close --reason.
```

**Behavior by `enforcement` mode:**

- `enforcement: strict` — **block /close**. Treat as a Phase 2 failure. Present the WARN block and exit without committing.
- `enforcement: warn` (default) — continue, but write `quality-gate-stubbed: true` to STATE.md Deviations so the metrics writer captures it.
- `enforcement: off` — silent. Emit a single-line `stderr` log only (`echo-stub detected: <check-name>`).

**Recipe:** for container-based test runners (e.g. EspoCRM PHPUnit) where an echo-stub was the historical workaround, see [`docs/recipes/quality-gate-container-pattern.md`](../../docs/recipes/quality-gate-container-pattern.md).

**Source issue:** GH #42 (root cause: a consumer-project #251 V0.15.7-close incident — silent false-positive close-verdicts from echo-stub test commands).

### 2.1 Vault Validation (if configured)

Read `skills/session-end/vault-operations.md` for validator bash contract and reporting matrix.

### 2.2 CLAUDE.md (or AGENTS.md) Drift Check (if configured)

Read `skills/session-end/drift-operations.md` for checker bash contract and reporting matrix. Complements 2.1: vault-sync validates frontmatter inside the vault tree; drift-check validates narrative claims (paths, counts, issue refs, session-file refs) in top-level repo docs.

### 2.3 Vault Staleness Check (if configured)

> Skip this subsection if `vault-staleness.enabled` is not `true` (default: `false`).

#### Step 1 — Resolve mode

Read `vault-staleness.mode` from `$CONFIG` (default: `warn`). Valid values: `off | warn | strict`.

If `mode === 'off'`, skip Phase 2.3 entirely.

#### Step 2 — Invoke staleness probes

Both probes already ship in `skills/discovery/probes/`. Invoke each via Node import (no shell-out):

```js
import { runProbe as runStaleness } from '$REPO_ROOT/skills/discovery/probes/vault-staleness.mjs';
import { runProbe as runNarrative }  from '$REPO_ROOT/skills/discovery/probes/vault-narrative-staleness.mjs';

const projectStaleness = await runStaleness(projectRoot, config);
const narrativeStaleness = await runNarrative(projectRoot, config);
```

Each probe returns `{ findings: Array, metrics: Object, duration_ms: Number }` and auto-appends a JSONL summary record to its respective metrics file.

#### Step 3 — Aggregate and route by mode

```
totalFindings = projectStaleness.findings.length + narrativeStaleness.findings.length
```

- `mode === 'warn'` (default): report findings to closing report Docs Health line. Never block close.
- `mode === 'strict'`:
  - If `totalFindings === 0`: continue, log `Vault staleness: clean (mode=strict)`.
  - If `totalFindings > 0`: do NOT block the close. Present the findings list and surface an AskUserQuestion whose Recommended default is **warn + carryover + continue**:
    - On Claude Code: AskUserQuestion with options:
      1. "Warn + carryover and close (Recommended)" — file a carryover issue (labels `carryover`, `priority::high`) titled `[Carryover] Vault staleness (strict) — <count> findings` documenting the stale projects/narratives for a follow-up session, log a Deviation entry in STATE.md `## Deviations`, then continue the close:
         `- [<ISO timestamp>] Phase 2.3: Vault staleness strict-mode findings carried over. Findings: <count> (projects: <N>, narratives: <M>) → issue #<IID>.`
      2. "Override and close" — proceed without a carryover issue, log a Deviation entry in STATE.md `## Deviations`:
         `- [<ISO timestamp>] Phase 2.3: Vault staleness strict-mode findings overridden by user. Findings: <count> (projects: <N>, narratives: <M>).`
         In addition to the Deviation entry, emit an override-ratio event so the override feeds the `override_ratio` metric (#730/H5): `node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.finding.overridden --payload '{"phase":"2.3","kind":"vault-staleness-strict","count":N}'`.
    - On Codex CLI / Cursor IDE: same options as numbered Markdown list.

#### Step 4 — Surface to closing report

Pass the aggregated counts and mode forward to Phase 6 Final Report (Docs Health line — see Phase 6 below).

## Phase 2.5: Custom Phases (#637)

> Opt-in. Skip this phase entirely if `custom-phases` in `$CONFIG` is absent or `[]` (the default).

Repos declare deterministic close/housekeeping phases as a **contract** (not the freeform `special:` convention): each phase runs a `command` with exit-code gating and Final-Report reporting. The block is parsed by `scripts/lib/config/custom-phases.mjs`; each record is `{ name, when, command, mode, review }` (already validated — unsafe records were dropped at parse time).

#### Step 1 — Read + filter by `when`

Read `custom-phases` from `$CONFIG` and the `session-type` from STATE.md frontmatter (`feature | deep | housekeeping | none`):

- If `session-type === 'housekeeping'`: keep phases with `when ∈ {housekeeping, both}`.
- Otherwise (`feature`/`deep`/any other): keep phases with `when ∈ {session-end, both}`.

If no phases remain after filtering, skip to Phase 3.

#### Step 2 — Run each phase in declaration order

For each kept phase:

- `mode === 'off'` ⇒ skip silently (do not run the command).
- Otherwise run `command` via Bash. Capture the **exit code** and the **last ~10 lines of stdout** (these become the report summary — do NOT inline the full output).
- If `review` is set, read that file after the command as the review step and note its path in the report.

#### Step 3 — Route by `mode`

- `mode === 'warn'` (default): record the result (name, exit code, summary) for the Phase 6 Final Report "Custom Phases" line. Never block the close — even on a non-zero exit.
- `mode === 'hard'`:
  - exit code `0` ⇒ continue; record `<name>: pass (mode=hard)`.
  - exit code `≠ 0` ⇒ **BLOCK the close** using the same routing pattern as Phase 2.3 strict-mode. `mode: hard` here is an operator-declared repo contract (the repo deliberately chose `mode: hard`), so the block semantics are preserved — but the AUQ now ALSO offers a warn + carryover escape hatch. Present the phase name + captured summary and offer:
    - On Claude Code: AskUserQuestion with options:
      1. "Fix and retry Phase 2.5" (Recommended) — exit close, let the user investigate.
      2. "Warn + carryover and close" — file a carryover issue (labels `carryover`, `priority::high`) titled `[Carryover] custom-phase '<name>' (mode=hard) exited <code>` capturing the phase name + captured summary for a follow-up session, log the Deviation entry, then continue the close.
      3. "Override and close" — proceed, log a Deviation entry in STATE.md `## Deviations`:
         `- [<ISO timestamp>] Phase 2.5: custom-phase '<name>' (mode=hard) exited <code>, overridden by user.`
         In addition to the Deviation entry, emit an override-ratio event so the override feeds the `override_ratio` metric (#730/H5): `node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.finding.overridden --payload '{"phase":"2.5","kind":"custom-phase-hard","count":N}'`.
      4. "Abort close" — exit close without writing.
    - On Codex CLI / Cursor IDE: same options as a numbered Markdown list.

A `hard`-fail (whether overridden or not) ALWAYS appends its result line to STATE.md `## Deviations`; `warn`-mode results do not.

#### Step 4 — Surface to closing report

Pass each phase result `(name, mode, exitCode, summary, review?)` forward to the Phase 6 Final Report "Custom Phases" line (see Phase 6 below).

## Phase 2.6: Broken-Window Budget (#730/H5)

> Opt-in via `broken-window-budget.enabled` in Session Config (default `false`).
> Skip silently when disabled.

Assemble the in-memory "knowingly-broken shipment" list from THIS session's
already-computed results — no new detection logic, only aggregation:

1. Phase 2.0a stub findings (`result.stubbed`) that shipped anyway under `enforcement: warn`.
2. Phase 2.3 / 2.5 "Override and close" choices (reuse each entry's Deviation-log payload verbatim).
3. Phase 1.8 MED/LOW findings routed to "Unresolved Review Findings" (#617).
4. Wave-level reviewer findings overridden without a fix task (`## Deviations` entries matching `reviewer finding overridden` — written by wave-executor §5/5a).

For EACH item: file a hard-terminated closure issue via `createBrokenWindowIssue()`
from `scripts/lib/spiral-carryover.mjs` — labels `broken-window` + `priority::high`,
due-date = today + `broken-window-budget.due-days` (default 7; `glab` native
`--due-date`, `gh` fallback: `Due: <date>` as first body line — GitHub has no
native due-date field). Idempotent per task-hash — re-running a close never
duplicates issues.

Emit ONE event per filed issue (note: event-name segments use underscores, never hyphens):

```bash
node scripts/emit-event.mjs --type orchestrator.broken_window.filed --payload \
  "$(node -e "process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({source:'<2.0a|2.3|2.5|1.8|wave-override>', issue:<IID>, due:'<YYYY-MM-DD>'}))")"
```

Non-blocking: a filing failure is a WARN, never blocks the close (same fail-open
discipline as `createSpiralCarryoverIssue`).

## Phase 3: Documentation Updates

> **Final heartbeat (#590-3)** — at Phase 3 entry, refresh the session-lock heartbeat BEFORE the multi-minute close-out chain (vault-mirror, dialectic, durable-commit, metrics). A long-idle deep session may not have had PostToolBatch activity for >4h; without a refresh the 4h-TTL lock would lapse mid-close and appear stale to a concurrent session. Place this call BEFORE Phase 3.8 Session Lock Release (which deletes the lock — refreshing a deleted lock is a no-op). Best-effort: a failure must NOT block the close.
>
> ```js
> // Final heartbeat (#590-3) — refresh before the multi-minute close-out (vault-mirror, dialectic, durable-commit)
> // so a long-idle deep session's 4h-TTL lock does not lapse mid-close.
> // BEFORE Phase 3.8 lock-release (which deletes the lock).

>
> Skip silently if `persistence: false` in Session Config (no session.lock exists in that mode).

### 3.0 Defensive Cleanup

Delete `<state-dir>/wave-scope.json` if it still exists:

```bash
rm -f <state-dir>/wave-scope.json
```

This should have been cleaned up by wave-executor after the final wave, but crashed sessions or interrupted executions may leave it behind. A stale scope manifest from a previous session could incorrectly restrict the next session's enforcement hooks.

### 3.1 SSOT Files
- Update `STATUS.md` / `STATE.md` if they exist (metrics, dates, status)
- Update `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md` on Codex CLI) if patterns or conventions changed during this session
- Check `<state-dir>/rules/` — if a new pattern was established, suggest a new rule file

### 3.2 Docs Verification (docs-orchestrator integration)

> Skip this subsection if `docs-orchestrator.enabled` config is not `true` (default: `false`). Also skip entirely if `docs-orchestrator.mode` is `off`.

Reads `docs-tasks` from STATE.md frontmatter (written by wave-executor Pre-Wave 1b), computes `CHANGED_FILES` via `git diff --name-only "$SESSION_START_REF..HEAD"`, and runs a per-task verification loop (outcome: `ok`/`partial`/`gap`). In `warn` mode logs results non-blocking; in `strict` mode blocks on any gap and presents an AskUserQuestion override prompt. Emits a `### Documentation Coverage (docs-orchestrator)` block for inclusion in the Phase 6 Final Report.

**See `phase-3-2-docs-verification.md` for full details.**

### 3.2a Session Handover (for significant sessions)
If this session made substantial changes, create or update:
- `<state-dir>/session-handover/` doc with: tasks completed, resume point, metrics changed, issues opened/closed
- Or update `<state-dir>/STATE.md` with session digest

### 3.3 Claude Rules Freshness
Review `<state-dir>/rules/` files that are relevant to this session's work:
- Are the rules still accurate after this session's changes?
- Should any rule be updated with new patterns?
- Should a new path-scoped rule be created?
- Suggest changes but DO NOT modify without user confirmation

### 3.4 Update STATE.md

> **Ownership Reference:** See `skills/_shared/state-ownership.md`. session-end is authorized to set `status: completed` plus the optional `updated` timestamp (#184), and — as of Phase A of Epic #271 — the 5 Recommendation fields written by Phase 3.7a. No other fields.

> **Runtime Ordering Note (Epic #271 Phase A):** Phase 3.4's `status: completed` write executes LAST in Phase 3, AFTER Phase 3.7 (sessions.jsonl) and Phase 3.7a (Compute and Write Recommendations). The ordinal position here (3.4) is kept for historical compatibility; the canonical runtime order is `3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4a → 3.5 → 3.5a → 3.6 → 3.6.3 → 3.6.4 → 3.6.5 → 3.6.6 → 3.6.7 → 3.6.8 → 3.7 → 3.45 → 3.7a → 3.7b → 3.7c → 3.7d → 3.4` (3.6.3/3.6.4/3.6.6 were missing from this note pre-#724; the Tail-Diät skip-plan dispatcher now dispatches the full six-phase tail mechanically, so the note is corrected to list all six). Rationale: Phase 3.7a reads in-memory session metrics and writes the 5 Recommendation fields via `updateFrontmatterFields`; that write must complete BEFORE the STATE.md frontmatter is finalized with `status: completed` so the Recommendation fields are visible to the next session-start while STATE.md is still `status: active`. Crash-resilience: if `/close` aborts between 3.7a and 3.4, STATE.md carries `status: active` + Recommendations; session-start Phase 1.5 offers resume (and the banner renders). If the reverse ordering were used (status: completed first), a crash would leave `status: completed` without Recommendations — the Reader would silently no-op the banner, losing the handoff. Phase 3.45 (Telemetry Flush, #844) sits AFTER Phase 3.7 because it drains the send-queue with the just-written `sessions.jsonl` record already included, and BEFORE Phase 3.7a because it is a fire-and-forget side-effect with no dependency on the Recommendation-write ordering below it. Phase 3.7d (Session-Eval, #803) sits AFTER Phase 3.7 because it scores the `sessions.jsonl` record that phase just wrote — the record must exist first — and BEFORE Phase 3.4 because its `eval.jsonl` output is advisory and must never block the close.

> Gate: Only run if `persistence` is enabled in Session Config and `<state-dir>/STATE.md` exists.
1. Set frontmatter `status: completed`
2. Record final wave count and completion time in the frontmatter
3. Touch `updated: <ISO 8601 UTC>` in the frontmatter (issue #184). Use `scripts/lib/state-md.mjs` → `touchUpdatedField` for safety:
   ```bash
   node --input-type=module -e "
   import {readFileSync, writeFileSync} from 'node:fs';
   import {touchUpdatedField} from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/state-md.mjs';
   const p = '<state-dir>/STATE.md';
   writeFileSync(p, touchUpdatedField(readFileSync(p, 'utf8'), new Date().toISOString()));
   "
   ```
   Silent no-op if the file has no frontmatter.
4. Keep the file as a record — do NOT delete it (next session-start reads it)

If STATE.md doesn't exist, skip this subsection.

### 3.4a Coordinator Snapshot Cleanup (#196)

Pre-dispatch snapshots (`refs/so-snapshots/<sessionId>/wave-*`) are created by wave-executor before each wave dispatch so that session-start can offer recovery if a session is interrupted mid-wave. On a clean close those snapshots are no longer needed and should be deleted. In addition, orphaned refs from older sessions that were never cleaned up (e.g. after a hard crash) are garbage-collected using an age-based policy (14 days).

> Gate: Only run if `persistence` is `true` in Session Config. Skip entirely when persistence is off (snapshots are never written in that mode).

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import { listSnapshots, deleteSnapshot, gcSnapshots } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/coordinator-snapshot.mjs';

// Step A: delete this session's snapshots (clean close → we don't need them)
const mine = await listSnapshots({ sessionId: '${SESSION_ID}' });
for (const s of mine) {
  const r = await deleteSnapshot({ refName: s.ref });
  if (!r.ok) console.error('snapshot cleanup:', r.error);
}

// Step B: GC orphans older than 14 days (non-fatal)
const gc = await gcSnapshots({ olderThanDays: 14 });
console.log(\`snapshot cleanup: deleted \${mine.length} from this session + \${gc.deletedCount} expired orphans (scanned \${gc.scanned}).\`);
"
```

Failures in either step are logged to stderr but do **not** block session close — a missed cleanup is self-healing via the 14-day GC on the next session.

This cleanup is the counterpart to the session-start Phase 1.5 recovery prompt: once a session closes cleanly, future sessions must not be offered recovery for its snapshots.

### 3.45: Telemetry Flush (advisory, #844)

> Skip silently when `persistence: false` in Session Config. There is **no dedicated config key** for this phase — the send-gate is `resolveConsent()` inside `sync.mjs` itself (fail-closed: a `disabled` / `no-consent` / headless posture makes `flush()` a no-op in <5ms, sending nothing). This phase runs late in the close, after Phase 3.7 has written `sessions.jsonl`, so any session-summary event enqueued at metrics-write time is included in the drain; the ordinal position `3.45` is kept for readability (mirrors the Phase 3.4 Runtime Ordering Note idiom of ordinal ≠ runtime order).

Drain the host-local telemetry send-queue once, fire-and-forget. The flush is **advisory** — the close must never fail, stall, or surface an error because of telemetry:

```javascript
import { flush } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/telemetry/sync.mjs';

// Fire-and-forget. flush() is contractually never-throw + internally gated (resolveConsent)
// + 3s-timeout-bounded; the try/catch is defense-in-depth, never a real failure path.
try { await flush(); } catch { /* nie blockierend — der Close darf durch Telemetrie nie scheitern */ }
```

**Semantics.** `flush()` is fire-and-forget with an internal ~3s timeout. When the ingest endpoint is unreachable (offline), events stay in the bounded host-local queue (oldest-dropped on overflow) and are retried on a later close — nothing is lost or blocked. A one-line result MAY be surfaced in the Phase 6 close summary (`Telemetry: sent` / `queued` / `gated`), but a failure NEVER renders an error banner: under no circumstances may telemetry make `/close` fail or take materially longer than ~3s. The gate lives in the module (fail-closed via `resolveConsent`), so this phase carries no config-key check of its own beyond the `persistence: false` skip above.

Cross-reference: GitLab #844 (Epic #841); `docs/prd/2026-07-20-anonymous-usage-telemetry.md` FA3; `docs/telemetry.md`; flush API in `scripts/lib/telemetry/sync.mjs` (`flush` — fire-and-forget, gated, never-throw).

### 3.5 Session Memory

> Gate: Only run if `persistence` is enabled in Session Config AND platform is Claude Code (session memory at `~/.claude/projects/` is Claude Code-only). Learnings (Phase 3.5a) and metrics (Phase 3.7) still write to `.orchestrator/metrics/` on all platforms.

1. Create `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/session-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with:
   - Frontmatter: `name`, `description` (1-line summary), `type: project`
   - `## Outcomes` — per-issue status (completed / partial / not started) with evidence
   - `## Learnings` — patterns discovered, architectural insights, gotchas
   - `## Next Session` — priority recommendations, suggested session type, blockers
2. Update `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md`:
   - Under a `## Sessions` heading (create if missing), add:
     `- [Session <date>](session-<date>.md) — <one-line summary>`

### 3.5a Learning Extraction + 3.6 Memory Cleanup & Learnings Write

Read `skills/session-end/learning-patterns.md` for extraction heuristics, confidence updates, passive decay, and JSONL write procedure.

### Phase 3.6.x Tail — Mechanical Skip-Plan (#724)

> The Phase 3.6.x tail (3.6.3 Memory-Proposals, 3.6.4 Expired-Sweep, 3.6.5 Auto-Dream, 3.6.6 Skill-Judge, 3.6.7 Auto-Dialectic, 3.6.8 Reconcile) is the historical close-out abort-attractor: six phases that in the overwhelming majority of sessions do nothing (no proposals queued, nothing expired, under cadence, judge off, reconcile off). Each already ships a mechanical fast-path in its own lib. This dispatcher computes — side-effect-free — WHICH of the six actually need to run, so you load ONLY the detail procedure for the `run: true` phases and emit a one-line skip report for the rest.

Run the aggregator ONCE. Config gates short-circuit FIRST (no disk touch); the input-detection helpers run only when the config gate passed. It NEVER throws — a per-phase probe error fail-opens to `run: true` (run the phase rather than silently lose it):

```javascript
import { planTailPhases } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/session-end/phase-skip.mjs';

const { plan, skippedReport } = await planTailPhases({
  repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  config,        // parsed Session Config (from $CONFIG)
  sessionId,     // session.lock `session_id` / STATE.md `session:` field (or null)
  platform,      // 'claude' | 'codex' | 'cursor'
});
// plan: Array<{ phase, run, reason, inputSource }>, already in ascending phase order.
```

Then:

1. **For every entry with `run: true`** — load its detail procedure from [`phase-3-6-tail.md`](./phase-3-6-tail.md) (the phase headings there match the `phase` id) and execute it exactly as written. The aggregator only DECIDES; the sub-file holds the full unabridged procedure.
2. **For every entry with `run: false`** — do nothing for that phase; its `reason` is already captured for the report.
3. **Execute `run: true` phases in ascending phase order** (3.6.3 → 3.6.4 → 3.6.5 → 3.6.6 → 3.6.7 → 3.6.8), matching the Phase 3.4 Runtime Ordering Note. The returned `plan` is already in that order.
4. **Emit `skippedReport`** as a single line in the Phase 6 Final Report (under the Learnings/metrics block), e.g. `Tail-Diät: 3.6.3 skipped (proposals empty) · 3.6.5 skipped (under-threshold) · 3.6.7 RUN (2 new sessions) · …`.

**Full detail procedures:** [`phase-3-6-tail.md`](./phase-3-6-tail.md).

### 3.7 Write Session Metrics

Read `skills/session-end/session-metrics-write.md` for JSONL append, vault-mirror invocation, and behavior matrix.

> **Token Rollup (#644):** Before emitting the JSONL record (step 2 of session-metrics-write.md), step 1a calls `rollupSessionTokens({ parentSessionId })` from `scripts/lib/session-token-rollup.mjs` and merges three optional fields onto the in-memory record: `total_token_input`, `total_token_output`, and `subagents_with_tokens` (coverage count). Null totals mean "no token data captured" — not zero cost. The rollup is non-blocking: a missing `subagents.jsonl` or all-null session still writes cleanly with null/0 values.

### 3.7a Compute and Write Recommendations (Epic #271 Phase A)

> Gate: Only run if `persistence` is `true` in Session Config AND `<state-dir>/STATE.md` exists. Skip silently otherwise.

> **Ownership Reference:** See `skills/_shared/state-ownership.md`. session-end is the ONLY writer of the 5 Recommendation fields (`recommended-mode`, `top-priorities`, `carryover-ratio`, `completion-rate`, `rationale`). No other skill may write these keys.

> **Ordering:** Runs AFTER Phase 3.7 (sessions.jsonl is just-written — reads in-memory session metrics, NOT JSONL) and BEFORE Phase 3.4 `status: completed` setting. See the Phase 3.4 Runtime Ordering Note for rationale.

Calls `computeV0Recommendation({completionRate, carryoverRatio, carryoverIssues})` from in-memory session metrics and writes 5 fields to STATE.md frontmatter via `updateFrontmatterFields`. Inputs MUST come from in-memory metrics, NOT re-read from `sessions.jsonl`. On any exception writes `recommendation-compute-failed` to `sweep.log` and does NOT block Phase 3.4.

**See `phase-3-7a-recommendations.md` for full details.**

### 3.7b Durable-Commit Session Telemetry (#490 AC2)

> Gate: Always runs when persistence is enabled. Local execution is a no-op (`enabled: false`).

> **Ordering:** Runs AFTER Phase 3.7a (Recommendations written to STATE.md) and BEFORE Phase 3.4 (`status: completed`). See the Phase 3.4 Runtime Ordering Note canonical order.

Wraps the already-completed Phase 3.7 + 3.7a writes with `withDurableCommit` (from `scripts/lib/autopilot/durable-telemetry.mjs`) for the two session-end-owned files: `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` and `<state-dir>/STATE.md`. `enabled: false` keeps local closes a no-op (`{ok: true, skipped: true}`); the flag flips `true` only in cloud Routines execution so telemetry survives ephemeral-clone reclamation. `autopilot.jsonl` is NOT in scope here — `scripts/lib/autopilot/loop.mjs` owns its commit (#490 Wave-2).

**See `phase-3-7a-recommendations.md` § Phase 3.7b for the full `withDurableCommit` invocation.**

### Phase 3.7c: Vault Board → Closed (#674)

> Gate: Skip silently when `vault-integration.enabled` is not `true` in Session Config (the underlying helper also self-no-ops, so this is defense-in-depth, not the sole gate).

> **Ordering:** Runs AFTER Phase 3.7b (durable-commit) and BEFORE Phase 3.7d (Session-Eval, #803), Phase 3.4 (`status: completed`) and Phase 3.8 (Session Lock Release). See the Phase 3.4 Runtime Ordering Note canonical order. Running before lock-release is deliberate — the session-lock lease still exists when the board is finalized, so the board's `in-progress → closed` transition is derived against a live lock rather than a phantom one. This mirrors the #490 durableCommit ordering discipline: persist/finalize the cross-repo status while the lease is still held, then release.

Transition THIS repo's live-status board row to `closed` so a cross-repo observer sees the session has ended. Invoke `mirrorBoard` from `scripts/lib/vault-status/board-writer.mjs` with an explicit `closed` status for the current repo:

```javascript
import { mirrorBoard } from 'scripts/lib/vault-status/board-writer.mjs';

const boardResult = await mirrorBoard({
  repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  explicitStatus: 'closed',        // force THIS repo's row to `closed`
});
// boardResult.action ∈ { 'written', 'skipped-noop', 'skipped-handwritten', 'skipped-vault-disabled', 'dry-run' }
```

> **Note (single-repo close path):** with `repos` omitted, `mirrorBoard` builds the repo descriptor itself as `[{ repoRoot, status: explicitStatus }]` — this is the supported single-repo shape, so `explicitStatus: 'closed'` lands on THIS repo's row. (When a caller DOES pass `repos`, each element must be a `{ repoRoot, repoName?, status? }` object, NOT a bare path string — bare strings are silently skipped by `collectRows`.) The board at `<vault-dir>/01-projects/_active-sessions.md` is generator-owned: `mirrorBoard` refuses to touch any file lacking the `session-orchestrator-active-sessions@1` marker, hard-refuses `_overview.md`, and is idempotent (a re-run after the row is already `closed` returns `skipped-noop`). Rows for repos NOT in this update are preserved verbatim by the idempotent merge.

**Non-blocking:** a `mirrorBoard` failure (any non-`written`/`skipped-*` outcome, thrown error, or unreachable vault) MUST NOT block the close. Log a single `WARNING: vault board → closed failed — <reason>; continuing close` line and proceed to Phase 3.4 / 3.8. The board is an observability convenience, not a close-out invariant.

### Phase 3.7d: Session-Eval (opt-in — #803)

> Gate: Run ONLY when Session Config has `eval.enabled: true` AND `eval.mode` is not `off` (the `eval:` block is parsed by `scripts/lib/config/eval.mjs`; defaults are `enabled:false / mode:warn / judge:off / report:html / handle:null`). With no `eval:` block at all, skip silently — zero overhead and byte-identical close behaviour to a repo that never adopted eval (FA6 Gherkin 2).

> **Ordering:** Runs AFTER Phase 3.7 (sessions.jsonl) and Phase 3.7c (vault board) and BEFORE Phase 3.4 (`status: completed`) and Phase 4 (commit). The position AFTER Phase 3.7 is load-bearing: the eval scores the session record that Phase 3.7 just appended to `sessions.jsonl`, so that record MUST already exist. The position BEFORE Phase 3.4 keeps the resulting `eval.jsonl` record inside the same session commit — but the record is purely advisory, so a failure here NEVER blocks the close. See the Phase 3.4 Runtime Ordering Note canonical order.

Evaluate the just-closed session deterministically and, when configured, with an advisory LLM judge. This phase is a thin hook — the full evaluation flow lives in `skills/eval/SKILL.md`; only the close-out integration is described here.

1. **Deterministic run.** Invoke `node scripts/eval-session.mjs --json` — with no `--session`, the cascade (`resolveSession`, revised #822) walks records newest-to-oldest (source order) and evaluates the first one that is either `status:'completed'` or non-abandoned with evidence of completed work (typically the record Phase 3.7 just appended). Model capture: the coordinator passes `--model-id <id> --model-source self-report`; the `$ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var wins automatically when set. Pass the configured pseudonym through with `--handle <eval.handle>` (omit when `null`). The CLI appends the eval record to `.orchestrator/metrics/eval.jsonl` (`appendEvalRecord` is never-throw).
2. **Advisory judge (opt-in).** When `eval.judge` is not `off`, run the judge flow per `skills/eval/SKILL.md` § Phase 3: the coordinator dispatches the read-only `eval-judge` agent (DI'd dispatch, untrusted-data nonce fence), merges the advisory judge dimensions (`method: "judge"`, `advisory: true`, `calibration_status: "uncalibrated"`) into the record, and appends the merged record. When `eval.judge: off`, no agent is dispatched and no judge dimensions are produced.
3. **HTML report (opt-in).** When `eval.report: html` (the default), call `writeEvalReport(record, …)` from `scripts/lib/eval/report.mjs` to emit the self-contained run report under `.orchestrator/eval/reports/<run-id>.html` (gitignored, regenerable from the record). When `eval.report: none`, skip the report.

**Advisory — never blocks the close (FA6):** an eval failure — a non-zero `eval-session.mjs` exit, a judge-dispatch error, or a report-write error — MUST NOT abort `/close`. Under `mode: warn`, log a single `WARNING: session-eval failed — <reason>; continuing close` line to stderr and proceed to Phase 3.8 / Phase 4. There is NO exit-code gate on this phase. See `skills/eval/SKILL.md` for the full deterministic-engine + judge + report detail flow.

## Phase 3.8: Session Lock Release (#330)

> Gate: Only run if `persistence` is `true` in Session Config. Skip silently otherwise.

After STATE.md is finalized with `status: completed` (Phase 3.4) and Recommendations are written (Phase 3.7a), release the distributed session-lock so the next session can acquire it cleanly:

```javascript
import { release } from 'scripts/lib/session-lock.mjs';
// sessionId = the session identifier established by session-start Phase 1.2 acquire()
//   and stored in .orchestrator/session.lock (session_id field); matches the
//   STATE.md frontmatter `session:` field written during Pre-Wave 1b initialization.
const result = release({ sessionId, repoRoot: process.cwd() });
// result.ok is always true unless a filesystem error occurred.
// result.deleted === true  → lock file removed successfully.
// result.deleted === false → lock was absent or belonged to a different session_id (silent-OK).
```

If `result.deleted === false`, log `info: session-lock not released — already absent or session_id mismatch (no action needed)` and continue. This is a non-error state.

If `result.ok === false` (rare filesystem error), log `⚠ session-lock: release failed — <result.reason>` and continue. Do NOT block the close for a lock-release failure — the TTL provides automatic expiry for the next session.

The lock is released here — AFTER all STATE.md writes are complete and BEFORE the commit is staged in Phase 4.1. This ordering ensures a clean handover: the lock file is absent from the working tree when the commit is assembled, so it is not accidentally staged.

## Phase 4: Commit & Push

### 4.1 Stage Changes
- **Stage files individually**: `git add <file>` — NEVER `git add .` or `git add -A`
- **Always stage these session artifacts** (if modified):
  - `.orchestrator/metrics/sessions.jsonl` (session summary from Phase 3.7)
  - `.orchestrator/metrics/learnings.jsonl` (learnings from Phase 3.6)
  - `.orchestrator/metrics/eval.jsonl` (eval record from Phase 3.7d, if modified — note: in repos where metrics are gitignored this is a no-op)
  - `<state-dir>/STATE.md` (session state, if persistence enabled)
  - Any files created or modified by wave agents
- Review staged changes: `git diff --cached` — verify every change is from THIS session
- If you see changes you did NOT make, ask the user (parallel session awareness)

### 4.2 Commit
Use Conventional Commits format:
```
type(scope): description

- [bullet points of what changed]
- Closes #IID1, #IID2 (if applicable)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

For sessions with many changes, prefer ONE commit per logical unit (not one mega-commit).

### 4.3 Push
```bash
git push origin HEAD
```

### 4.4 GitHub Mirror (if configured in Session Config)
```bash
# Only attempt if 'mirror: github' is in Session Config AND remote exists
git remote get-url github 2>/dev/null && git push github HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "GitHub mirror: not configured"
```

## Phase 4a: Auto-Promoted Worktree Cleanup (#575 P3.2)

> Skip if `persistence: false` in Session Config. Skip silently if the current worktree is NOT an Auto-promoted sibling (the common case).

After Phase 4 commit+push has durably persisted `sessions.jsonl` + `STATE.md` to origin, check whether the current session ran in an Auto-promoted sibling worktree (created via the P3.1 PROMOTION_OFFER path). If yes, apply Hybrid Cleanup-Pattern: clean → auto-remove, dirty → AUQ.

> **Ordering rationale (#490 durableCommit dependency):** Phase 4a runs AFTER Phase 4 commit+push, NOT before. Removing the promoted worktree before commit+push would lose the worktree's `STATE.md` before Phase 3.4 metrics writes (`sessions.jsonl`) are committed, violating the #490 durableCommit ordering invariant. Once Phase 4 has pushed all metrics + STATE.md to origin, the promoted worktree can be safely removed without data loss.

### Detection: is the current worktree an Auto-promoted sibling?

Auto-promoted sibling worktrees are created by `enterWorktree()` during the Phase 0.5 PROMOTION_OFFER path. Their path layout is `<basePath>/<repo-name>-<sessionId>/`. Detection uses `parseSessionId()` from `scripts/lib/session-id.mjs` (#572) — never custom regex.

> **Authoritative impl:** `scripts/lib/session-end/worktree-cleanup.mjs` — `detectAutoPromotedWorktree(repoRoot, sessionId, opts)`. Import and call; do NOT re-implement from this doc.
>
> Algorithm: parse `sessionId` via `parseSessionId()`; return `null` immediately for UUID-format sessions (never auto-promoted). Derive the MAIN checkout root from the first `worktree ` entry of `git worktree list --porcelain` (NOT `path.basename(repoRoot)` — the promoted worktree's basename IS the comparison target). If `repoRoot` resolves to the main checkout, return `null`. Otherwise compare `path.basename(repoRoot)` against `<main-repo-name>-<sessionId>`; on match return `{ wtPath, sessionId, branch }`, else `null`. All git invocation is via the injection-safe `opts.execFileFn` (default `execFileSync` with an args array — #577 HARDEN-001).

### Clean-check

A worktree is clean iff ALL three conditions hold:

1. **No uncommitted changes**: `git status --porcelain` is empty
2. **No untracked files**: implicit in #1 (porcelain includes `??` entries)
3. **No unpushed commits**: `git status --short --branch` does NOT contain `ahead` indicator

> **Authoritative impl:** `scripts/lib/session-end/worktree-cleanup.mjs` — `isWorktreeClean(wtPath, opts)`. Import and call; do NOT re-implement from this doc.
>
> Algorithm: run `git status --porcelain`; if non-empty → dirty (`false`). Else run `git status --short --branch`; if it matches `/\bahead\b/` → unpushed (`false`). Otherwise `true`. On ANY git error → `false` (conservative PSA-003 default: never auto-remove a worktree we could not verify). Git invocation is via the injection-safe `opts.execFileFn` (default `execFileSync` with an args array — #577 HARDEN-001).

### Clean path: auto-remove + WARN (PRD §3 P3 Gherkin row 2)

When detection returns a worktree object AND `isWorktreeClean()` returns `true`, auto-remove via `git worktree remove` (NO `--force`) and log a WARN line. The main checkout's git dir (`repoMainRoot`) is derived via the first entry of `git worktree list --porcelain`.

> **Authoritative impl:** import `detectAutoPromotedWorktree` + `isWorktreeClean` from `scripts/lib/session-end/worktree-cleanup.mjs`. All git invocation MUST go through the injection-safe arg-array form (`execFileSync('git', ['-C', dir, …])`, #577 HARDEN-001) — never the legacy `execSync(\`git -C ${var} …\`)` template-literal shell form.

```js
import { execFileSync } from 'node:child_process';
import { detectAutoPromotedWorktree, isWorktreeClean } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/session-end/worktree-cleanup.mjs';

const promoted = detectAutoPromotedWorktree(process.cwd(), sessionId);
if (!promoted) {
  // Not auto-promoted — skip Phase 4a entirely. Continue to Phase 5.
} else {
  // Derive main checkout root from first worktree-list entry (arg-array, no shell)
  const wtList = execFileSync('git', ['-C', promoted.wtPath, 'worktree', 'list', '--porcelain'], { encoding: 'utf8' });
  const mainLine = wtList.split('\n').find((l) => l.startsWith('worktree '));
  const repoMainRoot = mainLine ? mainLine.slice('worktree '.length).trim() : null;

  if (isWorktreeClean(promoted.wtPath)) {
    // Clean path: PRD §3 P3 Gherkin row 2 — auto-remove
    console.warn(`session-end Phase 4a: auto-promoted worktree ${promoted.wtPath} is clean — removing via 'git worktree remove'`);
    execFileSync('git', ['-C', repoMainRoot, 'worktree', 'remove', promoted.wtPath], { encoding: 'utf8' });
  } else {
    // Dirty path: PRD §3 P3 Gherkin row 3 — AUQ before any destructive action
    // [AUQ block — see Dirty path subsection below]
  }
}
```

### Dirty path: AUQ before destructive action (PRD §3 P3 Gherkin row 3)

When the worktree is dirty (uncommitted, untracked, OR unpushed), render this AUQ via the coordinator's `AskUserQuestion` tool. The AUQ is coordinator-only — per `.claude/rules/ask-via-tool.md` AUQ-004, dispatched agents cannot call AUQ. Calling `git worktree remove --force` without explicit operator confirmation would violate PSA-003 (destructive action safeguards) — the dirty state may contain another session's work-in-progress or unmerged commits.

```js
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: `Auto-promoted worktree at ${promoted.wtPath} has uncommitted/untracked/unpushed changes. How should I proceed?`,
    header: "Worktree-Cleanup",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Behalten (Recommended)", description: "Keep the worktree as-is. No cleanup. Review and remove manually later." },
      { label: "Löschen", description: "I confirm the changes are handled or expendable. Run 'git worktree remove --force' on the worktree." },
      { label: "Manuell", description: "Exit /close. I will inspect the worktree before re-running /close." },
    ],
  }],
});
```

**Codex CLI / Cursor IDE fallback** (numbered Markdown list):

```
Worktree cleanup options:
1. **Behalten (Recommended)** — Keep the worktree as-is. No cleanup. Review and remove manually later.
2. **Löschen** — I confirm the changes are handled or expendable. Run 'git worktree remove --force'.
3. **Manuell** — Exit /close. I will inspect the worktree before re-running /close.
Reply with the number of your choice.
```

**On user choice:**

- **Behalten** → log `session-end Phase 4a: auto-promoted worktree retained (dirty); operator chose Behalten`. Continue to Phase 5.
- **Löschen** → `execFileSync('git', ['-C', repoMainRoot, 'worktree', 'remove', '--force', promoted.wtPath])` (arg-array, no shell — #577 HARDEN-001). Log WARN: `session-end Phase 4a: auto-promoted worktree force-removed by user choice`. Continue to Phase 5.
- **Manuell** → exit `/close` cleanly. Print: `session-end aborted at Phase 4a by user choice. Re-run /close after handling the worktree manually.`

## Phase 4b: Worktree-Orphan Sweep (#831/B5)

> Skip if `persistence: false` in Session Config. Skip silently unless `worktree-orphans.enabled: true` (opt-in; default `false`).

Sweep the repo's worktree set for branches with **0 commits ahead of the base branch** — orphans left behind by finished sessions. Distinct from Phase 4a: 4a asks "did *this* session run in a promoted worktree?", 4b asks "which worktrees from *past* sessions have nothing left in them?".

> **Ordering rationale (#490 durableCommit dependency):** Phase 4b runs AFTER the Phase 4 commit+push, NOT before — the same invariant that governs Phase 4a. Removing a worktree before commit+push would lose its `STATE.md` before the Phase 3.4 `sessions.jsonl` metrics writes are committed. See `docs/adr/0008-worktree-cleanup-ordering.md`.

### The module proposes; the coordinator disposes

> **Authoritative impl:** `scripts/lib/session-end/worktree-orphan-sweep.mjs` — `checkWorktreeOrphans({ repoRoot, mainCheckoutRoot, config, execFileFn })`. Import and call; do NOT re-implement from this doc.

`checkWorktreeOrphans()` **executes zero mutating commands.** Its complete argv set is four read-only shapes — `worktree list --porcelain`, `rev-list --count --end-of-options <base>..<branch>`, and (via the reused Phase 4a helper `isWorktreeClean`) `status --porcelain` and `status --short --branch` — all via the injection-safe arg-array form (`execFileSync('git', ['-C', dir, …])`, #577 HARDEN-001), never a template-literal shell string. It returns `null` (silent no-op) or ONE object `{ severity: 'warn', message, candidates: [{ wtPath, branch, sessionId, aheadCount: 0 }] }`.

**`--end-of-options` is load-bearing, not decoration.** `base-branch` comes from Session Config, and a value shaped like a git flag (e.g. `--glob=refs/heads/*`) is otherwise parsed by `rev-list` as an OPTION rather than a revision range — which exits 0 and prints `0`, silently marking EVERY worktree as a 0-ahead orphan and offering the operator "Löschen" for worktrees full of live work. That is not an error path the conservative default catches, because `0` parses fine. `--end-of-options` turns the payload into a hard git error that DOES fall into the conservative `continue`, and `_isSafeBaseBranch` in the config parser rejects leading-dash values at the source. No attacker is needed for this — a typo reaches the same outcome.

**The gate is opt-in and fails CLOSED:** the module returns `null` unless `enabled === true`. It accepts either the full config object or the already-indexed `worktree-orphans` block, so neither call shape can accidentally open the gate.

**A dirty worktree is never a candidate.** Orphan-ness is not decided by commit count alone — `isWorktreeClean()` is consulted first, and any uncommitted, staged or untracked work (or any git error while checking) excludes the worktree entirely. A worktree that is 0-ahead but holds live work is exactly the case where a deletion prompt would cost real data.

The return field is named `candidates`, not `orphans` or `removals`, and the name is load-bearing: **the coordinator decides, the module never does.** Grounding: `.claude/rules/parallel-sessions.md` § PSA-003 — *"Did I create this file/commit/change? If not, it is not mine to touch."* A sweep probe created none of the worktrees it inspects.

**Nothing is removed without explicit operator confirmation.** The rendered banner always ends with the literal clause `nothing was removed.` — the operator-visible proof of the invariant.

**Conservative default (safety-critical):** any git error, unparseable `rev-list` output, detached HEAD, unresolvable branch, or ambiguity of any kind → that worktree is NOT reported as a candidate. A failing sibling never suppresses a healthy finding, and silence is never to be read as "safe to delete".

### The AUQ is rendered by the coordinator, never by the module

`AskUserQuestion` is unavailable inside dispatched subagents (`.claude/rules/ask-via-tool.md` AUQ-004), so the module returns data only and the **coordinator** renders the picker — one call per candidate.

**Option order is locked and is itself a safety property (#580-AUQ-001): the non-destructive option goes FIRST and is marked `(Recommended)`, so an accidental Enter keypress can never destroy a worktree.**

`[ Behalten (Recommended) / Löschen / Manuell ]`

- **Behalten (Recommended)** — leave the worktree in place; re-surfaces next session.
- **Löschen** — operator explicitly authorises removal; the coordinator performs it, subject to PSA-003.
- **Manuell** — operator handles it outside the session; no further prompting this session.

```js
import { checkWorktreeOrphans } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/session-end/worktree-orphan-sweep.mjs';

const sweep = checkWorktreeOrphans({
  repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  config: config['worktree-orphans'],
});

if (sweep) {
  console.warn(sweep.message);
  // → coordinator renders the AUQ per sweep.candidates entry.
  //   [ Behalten (Recommended) / Löschen / Manuell ]
  //   Nothing is removed unless the operator picks "Löschen".
}
```

## Phase 5: Issue Cleanup

> **VCS Reference:** Use CLI commands per the "Common CLI Commands" section of the gitlab-ops skill.

1. **Close resolved issues**: Before closing each issue, strip `status:*` workflow labels using `stripStatusLabels` from `scripts/lib/issue-close-strip-labels.mjs` (#308). A closed issue carrying `status:in-progress` or `status:ready` skews dashboard filters and discovery heuristics. Then close and add a note using the issue close and note commands per the "Common CLI Commands" section of the gitlab-ops skill. Note: some VCS platforms require separate note and close commands.

   ```js
   import { stripStatusLabels } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/issue-close-strip-labels.mjs';

   // For each resolved issue IID:
   const { stripped, error } = await stripStatusLabels({ issueId: iid, vcs: '<from Session Config>' });
   if (error) {
     console.warn(`⚠ label strip failed for #${iid}: ${error} — proceeding with close`);
   } else if (stripped.length) {
     console.log(`Stripped ${stripped.join(', ')} from #${iid}`);
   }
   // then: glab issue close <iid> / gh issue close <iid>
   ```

   The call is idempotent: if the issue has no `status:*` labels, no update CLI call is made. Failures from `stripStatusLabels` are non-fatal — log and proceed with close.

2. **Update in-progress issues**: ensure labels reflect actual state using the issue update command
3. **Create carryover issues — from the Phase 1.65 gate's carry-list ONLY (#769):** file an issue for each item on the carry-list produced by the Handover Alignment Gate — i.e. the non-deselectable **auto-carry** class (`priority::critical|high`, SPIRAL/FAILED, or no-origin-issue candidates) PLUS the middle-band items the operator LEFT SELECTED in triage. Do NOT file anything the gate dropped, and do NOT file directly from Phase 1.2/1.3/1.4/1.6 — those phases only collected candidates.
   - **Template stays source-specific:** 1.2 Partially-Done → `[Carryover] <task>` (labels `priority::<original>`, `status:ready`); 1.4 unfinished Emergent → a **normal** issue (NOT the `[Carryover]` template); 1.6 SPIRAL/FAILED → fire the deferred `createSpiralCarryoverIssue({ taskDescription, kind, context, priority: 'high', vcs })` (idempotent task-hash dedup — payload comes from the candidate's `_spiral` annotation set in Phase 1.6 step 5). 1.3 files no NEW issue: a carried 1.3 candidate simply keeps its ORIGINAL issue `status:ready`.
   - **Dropped middle-band items:** file NO `[Carryover]` duplicate; the origin issue stays open and unchanged. Record each drop in the Phase 6 Final Report under `### Dropped at Handover Gate` with its origin-issue reference and a reason slot.
   - **Fail-open / gate skipped:** when Phase 1.65 skipped fail-open, the carry-list is ALL candidates (status quo) and there is no drop-list.
   - **Mark answered open questions `[x]` durably — atomic with the filing above (#769):** now, on the completed side of the Quality Gate, persist each answered open question captured in-memory at Phase 1.65 Step 4 to STATE.md via the lock-guarded sibling helper (PSA-005). Co-locating this write with the carryover-issue filing is the load-bearing correctness invariant: an earlier Quality-Gate abort leaves every question `- [ ]` on disk, so it correctly re-surfaces via `readOpenQuestions().filter(!answered)` on re-close — the `[x]` mark now reflects a COMPLETED handover, never a mid-close state a later abort would invalidate. Any implied-work candidate an answered question enqueued in Phase 1.65 is filed by the carry-list step above, so the mark and its issue land together:

     ```js
     import { markOpenQuestionAnsweredOnDisk } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/state-md.mjs';
     // answeredQuestions captured in Phase 1.65 Step 4 (in-memory, un-persisted until now)
     for (const { question, answer } of answeredQuestions) {
       await markOpenQuestionAnsweredOnDisk(repoRoot, question, answer); // "- [ ] Q" → "- [x] Q → Antwort: <answer>"
     }
     ```

     Fail-open: a `markOpenQuestionAnsweredOnDisk` failure is non-fatal — log a WARN and proceed with the close; the question simply stays `- [ ]` and roundtrips to the next session.

3b. **Drain the issue-budget overflow — exactly ONE collector artefact (issue-budget):** when `.orchestrator/runtime/issue-budget.json` has a non-empty `overflow[]`, the session hit its `issue-budget.max-per-session` cap and every over-cap creation was PARKED rather than filed. Fold the whole list into a single artefact so nothing is silently dropped.

    **Ordering (load-bearing):** run this as the LAST issue-creating action of Phase 5 — after step 3, after "Discovery Issue Creation", after step 4 — and re-read the counter file at that moment. Those steps can themselves push new entries into `overflow[]`; draining early would leave them unfiled.

    ```js
    import { readBudgetState, budgetStatePath } from '${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/issue-budget.mjs';
    const state = readBudgetState(repoRoot, sessionId);   // { sessionId, count, exempt, overflow: [...] }
    ```

    - **`issue-budget.overflow: collect-issue` (default)** — create exactly ONE issue:
      - Title: `[Backlog-Sammel] <session-id>, <N> zurückgestellte Punkte`
      - Labels: `type::backlog`, `priority::low`
      - Body: a Markdown checklist with one `- [ ]` line per `overflow[]` entry (`title` when present, otherwise the truncated `command`, plus its `at` timestamp).
      - This collector issue is itself EXEMPT from the cap (`[Backlog-Sammel]` is in the exemption list in `scripts/lib/issue-budget.mjs`), so it always lands even at count == max.
    - **`issue-budget.overflow: vault-note`** — create NO issue. Write one Markdown file `vault/00-inbox/<session-id>-backlog-sammel.md` (path relative to `vault-integration.vault-dir`) with valid vault frontmatter and the same checklist body.
    - After the artefact exists, reset `overflow` to `[]` in the counter file and record the collector issue ID / note path in the Phase 6 Final Report under `### Zurückgestellt (issue-budget)`.
    - **Never exempt-by-accident:** the cap never applied to `priority::critical`, the carryover class (`[Carryover]`, SPIRAL/FAILED, `type::carryover`), or `broken-window` closure issues, so nothing on the Phase 1.65 carry-list can ever appear in `overflow[]`. The promises at Phase 1.8 ("SPIRAL / FAILED agent carryover … non-deselectable") and the Critical Rule "ALWAYS create issues for unfinished PLANNED work" stay intact by construction.
    - Fail-open: a missing or malformed counter file means "no overflow" — log a WARN and continue the close.

#### Discovery Issue Creation (if discovery ran in Phase 1.5)

For each finding with severity `critical` or `high` from Phase 1.5:
1. Create a VCS issue using the detected platform CLI:
   - Title: `[Discovery] <description>` (truncated to 70 chars)
   - Body: `**Probe:** <probe>\n**File:** <file>:<line>\n**Severity:** <severity>\n**Confidence:** <confidence>%\n**Recommendation:** <recommendation>`
   - Labels: `type:discovery`, `priority::<severity>` (critical→critical, high→high)
2. Log each created issue ID for the Final Report
3. Update `discovery_stats.issues_created` count

4. **Create gap issues for HIGH+/blocking newly-discovered problems only** — MED/LOW review findings are recorded in the Final Report, not filed as issues (#617; see the Phase 1.8 severity-disposition table). This mirrors the Phase 5 "Discovery Issue Creation" gate (critical/high only).
5. **Update milestones**: if milestone progress changed

```

> **Documentation Coverage anchor:** If Phase 3.2 ran and produced task verification results (i.e. `docs-orchestrator.enabled: true` and `docs-tasks` were found), the results appear here as a `### Documentation Coverage (docs-orchestrator)` subsection emitted by Phase 3.2 Step 7. The content is written dynamically — it is not pre-populated in this template. When `docs-orchestrator.enabled` is `false` or `docs-tasks` were absent, this subsection is omitted entirely.

| `learning-patterns.md` | Phases 3.5a + 3.6 extraction heuristics, confidence updates, passive decay, and JSONL write procedure |
| `phase-3-6-tail.md` | Phase 3.6.x tail — full unabridged detail procedures for all six tail phases: 3.6.3 Memory-Proposals Collection (`collectProposals` + AUQ multiSelect + `promoteAndClear`, composing `writeApproved` + `clearProposalsJsonl` behind a mechanical write-before-clear guard, #828), 3.6.4 Expired-Learnings Sweep (Epic #723 B4), 3.6.5 Auto-Dream nudge (`shouldDispatchAutoDream`, #614), 3.6.6 Skill-Applied Judge (#645 L3 — `runSkillJudge`, coordinator-writes), 3.6.7 Auto-Dialectic nudge (`shouldDispatchAutoDialectic`, #614), 3.6.8 Reconciliation Rule Proposals (#696 FA3 — `runReconcile` + AUQ + `writeApprovedRules`). Loaded on demand by the SKILL.md skip-plan dispatcher (#724) — only phases with `run: true` in the `planTailPhases()` plan execute |
| `scripts/lib/session-end/phase-skip.mjs` | Phase 3.6.x tail skip-plan aggregator (#724) — `planTailPhases({repoRoot, config, sessionId, platform})` → `{plan, skippedReport}`; side-effect-free (reconcile/sweep via dry-run — no writes), never-throws (per-phase probe error fail-opens to `run: true`); wraps the six existing signal helpers with config gates first, then input detection |
| (inline) Phase 3.45 | Telemetry Flush (advisory, #844) — `flush()` from `scripts/lib/telemetry/sync.mjs` drains the host-local send-queue fire-and-forget; no config key (send-gate is `resolveConsent()` inside the module, fail-closed); skip when `persistence: false`; never-throw + ~3s-bounded, offline → bounded oldest-dropped queue, optional `Telemetry: sent/queued/gated` close-summary line, NEVER an error banner; runs late in the close after Phase 3.7 |

| (inline) Phase 3.7c | Vault Board → Closed (#674) — `mirrorBoard({ explicitStatus: 'closed' })` transitions this repo's board row to `closed`; gated on `vault-integration.enabled`, generator-marked + idempotent, non-blocking, ordered after 3.7b and before 3.7d/3.4/3.8 |
| (inline) Phase 3.7d | Session-Eval (opt-in — #803) — `node scripts/eval-session.mjs --json` scores the just-closed session; gated on `eval.enabled` + `eval.mode != off` (parsed by `scripts/lib/config/eval.mjs`), optional `eval-judge` dispatch + `writeEvalReport`, advisory/never-blocks-close, ordered after 3.7 (record must exist) and before 3.4/Phase 4 (record committed with the session). Full flow in `skills/eval/SKILL.md` |
| (inline) Phase 3.8 | Session Lock Release — `release()` call, silent-OK on mismatch/absent, non-fatal on fs-error, ordering note (after STATE.md writes, before Phase 4 commit staging) |

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** commit before running quality gates — a "clean commit" with TypeScript errors is not clean
- **DO NOT** mark issues as closed without verifying the implementation actually addresses them
- **DO NOT** skip creating tracking issues for unfinished work — "I'll remember for next session" always fails
- **DO NOT** use `git add .` or `git add -A` — parallel sessions may have uncommitted work in the tree
- **DO NOT** push to mirrors before verifying origin push succeeded — broken state propagates

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER claim work is done without running verification** — evidence before assertions
- **NEVER commit with TypeScript errors** — 0 errors is non-negotiable
- **NEVER use `git add .`** — stage files individually to avoid capturing parallel session work
- **NEVER skip issue updates** — VCS must reflect reality after every session
- **ALWAYS create issues for unfinished PLANNED work** — SPIRAL/FAILED agent carryover and partially-done plan items (Phase 1.2 / 1.6) ALWAYS get a ticket; nothing planned-but-unfinished is "remembered" without one. The `issue-budget` per-session cap does NOT weaken this: `priority::critical`, the carryover class (`[Carryover]`, `[SPIRAL]`/`[FAILED]`, `type::carryover`, bare `carryover`) and `broken-window` closure issues are exempt from the cap by construction (`scripts/lib/issue-budget.mjs` `EXEMPT_RULES`). Non-exempt over-cap creations are not dropped either — they are parked and folded into one `[Backlog-Sammel]` collector in Phase 5 Step 3b.
- **DO NOT auto-file MED/LOW review findings as issues** — newly-surfaced reviewer findings (Phase 1.8 / W4 panel) at MED or LOW severity are folded in-session or recorded in the Final Report under "Unresolved Review Findings". Only HIGH+/blocking review findings get an issue. (Issue #617 — stops the self-referential low-priority backlog.)
- **ALWAYS push to origin** — local-only work is lost work
- **ALWAYS mirror to GitHub** if configured — keep mirrors in sync
- **ALWAYS review `git diff --cached`** before committing — verify only YOUR changes are staged
