# Research

Research a topic using the `deep-research` MCP server.

## Working Directory

All output goes into `outputs/{slug}/` relative to the project root. Derive the slug from:
- The dataset seed filename if the user references one (e.g., `my-topic_seed.md` → `my-topic`)
- Otherwise, slugify the topic (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars, max 60 chars)

Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

## Execution

1. Load the `research_workflow` MCP prompt from the `deep-research` server.
2. Follow the workflow instructions to research the user's topic using the available tools:
   - `deep_research` — for web research queries
   - `analyze_youtube_video` — for any YouTube URLs the user provides
   - `compile_research` — to produce the final research.md
3. Use `outputs/{slug}/` as the `working_dir` for all tool calls.

## After Completion

Show the user the path to `outputs/{slug}/research.md` and a brief summary of what was found.
