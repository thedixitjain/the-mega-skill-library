# Capability Discovery

The pipeline should never invent tools. Before drafting a kit that references
GitHub Actions, Supabase, Codex, or any other external dependency, check what
actually exists.

## What we detect

- **CLI tools on $PATH**: `gh`, `git`, `node`, `go`, `rustc`, `cargo`,
  `python3`, `pip`, `docker`, `vercel`, `supabase`, `firebase`, `wrangler`,
  `ffmpeg`, `playwright`, `codex`, `graphify`.
- **MCP servers**: parsed from `.mcp.json` in the project root and
  `~/.claude.json` (user level).
- **Claude Code plugins**: parsed from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`.
- **Codex**: presence of the `codex` CLI (enables peer-review commands).
- **Knowledge graph**: presence of `graphify-out/graph.json` (enables the
  `graphify-integration` skill).

## Running discovery

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cavekit-tools.cjs" discover
```

Writes `.cavekit/capabilities.json`:

```json
{
  "discovered_at": "2026-04-17T14:22Z",
  "cli_tools": {
    "gh": true, "git": true, "node": true, "codex": false
  },
  "mcp_servers": ["codex-reviewer", "graphify"],
  "plugins": [],
  "codex": { "available": false }
}
```

## How other commands use it

- **`/ck:sketch`** — reads capabilities before proposing integrations. If a
  kit would need a missing tool, it either adds a "Setup" task to the build
  site or asks the user whether to proceed without it.
- **`/ck:map`** — flags tasks that depend on missing capabilities as
  `blocked: setup-required`.
- **`/ck:make`** — refuses to dispatch subagents that require a missing MCP
  server.
- **`/ck:check`** — includes a "Capability Coverage" section in the inspect
  report.

## When to re-run

- After installing a new CLI tool.
- After adding or removing an MCP server.
- At the start of every new project (via `/ck:init`).
- Whenever a task fails with "command not found".

The file is cheap to regenerate — always discover, never guess.

## What we deliberately do not detect

- Network-accessible APIs behind credentials. Availability is not reachability;
  kits should record credentials as a separate concern (never committed).
- IDE extensions. They are not scriptable from the loop and would create false
  assurances.
- Language versions. Version-pinning is the project's responsibility
  (package.json / go.mod / pyproject.toml); discovery only confirms
  executables exist.
