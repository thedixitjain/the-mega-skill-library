# Learn

Learn is an optional, off-path consumer of durable `verdict.v2` collections.
It may summarize recurring evidence and propose a candidate deterministic check
for later human or caller evaluation.

Learn does not run during RPI, validate a subject, alter a verdict, mutate a
plan, promote a rule, choose continuation, or emit a lifecycle receipt. Missing
Learn output never changes whether a candidate is valid.

When invoked, bind every observation to verdict and finding digests, distinguish
repeated objectives from repeated reviews of one objective, disclose the sample
size, and stop at advisory evidence.

Overweight failures: a `NOT_PROVEN` or `FAIL` verdict carries more teaching
value than a PASS, because it names a rule the loop lacked. Harvest kernels
from failed lanes first — the 2026-07-15 `NOT_PROVEN`
(`.agents/ao/verdicts/sha256/b6e759dd...cb6a`, a subject destroyed by a
mutating check mid-validation) produced more durable rules than the PASS
(`e9b6cdb8...37b9`) that followed it.

Prune for provenance decay: every cited artifact must still resolve — the
file exists or the verdict digest is present in `.agents/ao/verdicts/`. Dead
citations get pruned rather than paraphrased, and confidence in a lesson that
has not been reproduced since its source decayed goes down, not sideways.
