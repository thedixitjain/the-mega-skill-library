# Swarm

Swarm exposes one optional factory port:

```text
dispatch_once(explicit_disjoint_packets, executor)
  -> per-packet candidate | evidence | error
```

The caller supplies every complete packet, proves their write scopes disjoint,
and chooses the executor. Swarm dispatches each packet once, preserves packet and
context identities, collects results, and stops.

Exactly-once dispatch over proven-disjoint scopes is why parallel failures stay
independent: no packet can observe, block, or corrupt another, so N packets
yield N verdicts about N experiments rather than one tangle.

Named failure mode — **partial-batch launch**: dispatching valid packets before
discovering an invalid one, leaving the batch half-run; validate the entire
batch before the first call.

Anti-pattern: re-dispatching a packet whose executor returned an error.
Corrective: return the error as that packet's factual result; retry is the
caller's decision, not the dispatcher's.

The reference implementation is [`scripts/dispatch_once.py`](scripts/dispatch_once.py).
It validates the entire explicit batch before the first call, invokes the supplied
executor exactly once for each packet, and returns executor exceptions as factual
per-packet errors.

Swarm does not select work, create packets, schedule from a backlog, persist a
queue, claim ownership, retry, validate, integrate, close, use Git, or deliver.
Executor failures remain executor evidence and cannot become core phase or
verdict state.
