"""
Aligns a Python recipe's pyproject.toml with the repo's standards.

Enforces the same pyproject.toml rules that
.github/workflows/python-validate-recipe.yml checks in CI, plus one critical
additional check.

MAINTENANCE NOTE — keep in sync with the CI validator. Four of these rules
(project-name-matches-folder, python-version-floor, description-matches-
manifest, default-pypi-index) are also implemented independently by
.github/scripts/check_recipe_pyproject.py. That script only READS/validates
(stdlib tomllib + pyyaml, so CI needs no extra deps); this one REWRITES
(comment-preserving tomlkit + ruamel.yaml). They are intentionally separate
but MUST stay semantically in sync — if you change a rule's meaning here,
mirror it there (and vice versa).

  - no-local-ruff-config
        Recipe pyproject.toml must not declare any [tool.ruff*] table. Ruff
        configuration is centralized in the root pyproject.toml.
        Auto-fix: remove the tables.
        (Standalone ruff.toml / .ruff.toml files are also forbidden but are
        outside this skill's scope — see the workflow's Check 7.)
  - python-version-floor
        [project].requires-python must ACCEPT Python 3.11 exactly — it must
        neither permit anything below (loose floor like >=3.10) nor exclude
        3.11 by requiring higher (>=3.12 etc.). Per AGENTS.md "Minimum python
        version: 3.11" and CI in .github/workflows/python-dependency-policy.yml,
        which pins Python 3.11 and would otherwise emit a confusing "lockfile
        is out of date" error whose real cause is the interpreter mismatch.
        Auto-fix: rewrite the specifier so its lower bound is >=3.11 while
        preserving every upper bound, exclusion, compatible-release ceiling,
        and pin (only the pure lower-bound operators >= and > are dropped
        or replaced). Applies to BOTH failure modes — loose floors (>=3.10)
        and higher-than-min floors (>=3.12). If the rewrite would produce a
        self-contradictory result — because the recipe's own ceiling/pin/
        exclusion still excludes 3.11 after lowering (e.g. `>=3.10,!=3.11`,
        `==3.10.*`, or `~=3.12` where the compatible-release ceiling shuts
        out 3.11) — refuse to apply and return NEEDS_INPUT for a human to
        resolve (typically: relax the ceiling, or raise the recipe with
        the maintainers to update CI's pinned interpreter).
  - project-name-matches-folder
        [project].name must equal the recipe folder basename.
        Auto-fix: set it.
  - description-matches-manifest
        If [project].description is set, it must equal manifest.description.
        Auto-fix requires --description-source={pyproject,manifest,delete}
        to resolve; refuses to touch description without an explicit choice.
  - build-system-present (report-only)
        [build-system] must have both `requires` and `build-backend`.
        Without it, `uv build` and `pip install .` fail. Not auto-fixed
        because the canonical backend is an editorial choice (hatchling vs
        uv_build).
  - default-pypi-index
        [[tool.uv.index]] must have an entry with default=true pointing at
        public PyPI (https://pypi.org/simple[/]). Required so `uv sync` works
        on Google corp workstations without corp Airlock auth.
        Auto-fix: when no default index is declared, promote an existing
        public-PyPI entry to default=true, or append one if none exists.
        Report-only when a default entry exists but points elsewhere (private
        mirror, TestPyPI) — the divergence may be intentional.

Usage:

    python align_pyproject.py --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR> --dry-run
    python align_pyproject.py --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR>
    python align_pyproject.py --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR> \\
        --description-source={pyproject,manifest,delete}

Output:

    Prints a JSON report to stdout. The caller (a coding agent) is expected
    to render it into markdown for the user. Exit code:

      0  dry-run: always. apply: nothing left unfixed that could have been.
      1  apply mode found at least one issue it could not resolve (typically
         a description-matches-manifest mismatch without
         --description-source, or a bug).

      1. **Permits versions below MIN_PYTHON** (e.g. `>=3.10`, `~=3.10`,

    Two code paths depending on whether any `[[tool.uv.index]]` AoT already

    1. AoT already present (recipe has index entries but none marked
       `default=true`): append a new entry into the existing AoT via
       tomlkit. Placement is unambiguous — the new entry sits with its
       siblings, which is exactly what the user wants.

    2. AoT NOT present (nothing under `[tool.uv.index]` at all): DO NOT let
       tomlkit place the new block. tomlkit places a newly-created nested
       AoT immediately after its parent's last child table, and that
       position can fall INSIDE a trailing comment block that visually
       introduces the NEXT top-level table. In real recipes with a
       `[tool.uv.build-backend]` sub-table followed by comments introducing
       `[tool.agent-starter-pack]`, tomlkit will wedge the new
       `[[tool.uv.index]]` between those comments and their target table,
       silently reassigning comment ownership. To avoid this, defer the
       block to a raw string append after `tomlkit.dumps(doc)` — see
       `_persist_changes`. The string always lands at the end of the file,
       which is unambiguous and preserves every comment's semantic
       attribution.

    Existing non-default `[[tool.uv.index]]` entries are preserved either
    way and remain higher-priority (per uv's index ordering).

    No leading comment is emitted — tomlkit attaches comments passed to a
    table INSIDE the table (after its header), which reads awkwardly.
    Recipes hand-edited by the scaffold-python-recipe template or the
    prepare-python-recipe skill get a single-line comment (`# Use public
