# Fable 5 Coverage Matrix

This matrix is the accountability layer for a Codex-native Fable 5 adaptation. It does not measure model capability or textual imitation. It measures whether every named source section has an explicit Codex decision: implemented, adapted, unsupported, or not applicable.

Status definitions:

- `implemented`: Codex has a direct operational surface for the behavior.
- `adapted`: Codex can preserve the intent through different tools, files, apps, or policy.
- `unsupported`: the exact Claude/Fable capability is not available; use the documented fallback.
- `not_applicable`: provider identity, environment, or hidden-runtime material that Codex must not import.

## Section Coverage

## Completion Target

A 100% score means every source heading is accounted for in this matrix and has an explicit Codex-native decision. It does not mean exact Claude/Fable behavior, hidden runtime parity, or Fable model capability. Those require the actual provider and runtime.
