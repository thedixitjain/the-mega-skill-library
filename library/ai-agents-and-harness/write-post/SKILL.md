# Write LinkedIn Post

Generate a LinkedIn post using the `linkedin-writer` MCP server.

## Working Directory

All output goes into `outputs/{slug}/` relative to the project root. Derive the slug from:
- The dataset seed/guideline filename if the user references one (e.g., `my-topic_seed.md` → `my-topic`)
- Otherwise, slugify the topic (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars, max 60 chars)

Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

## Input Preparation

The working directory needs `guideline.md` and `research.md`.

If the user provides raw text for the guideline, create `guideline.md` in the working directory:

```markdown
# LinkedIn Post Guideline

## Topic
[What the post is about]

## Angle
[What perspective or approach to take]

## Target Audience
[Who this post is for]

## Key Points to Cover
[3-5 bullet points]

## Tone
[How it should sound]
```

If `research.md` is in a different location, copy it into the working directory.

## Execution

Read the `WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS` from `src/writing/routers/prompts.py` and follow those steps exactly, using the `linkedin-writer` MCP tools. Pass `outputs/{slug}/` as the working directory path to each tool.

## After Completion

Present the final `outputs/{slug}/post.md` content to the user. If an image was generated, mention `outputs/{slug}/post_image.png`.
