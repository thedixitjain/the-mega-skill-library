extract_env_vars.py

Scans a Python recipe directory and:
  1. Detects all environment variable accesses in non-test Python files
     — including ``os.environ.setdefault("V", "d")``, whose "d" would
     otherwise be a hidden default that a user editing .env.example has
     no way to discover.
  2. Creates or updates .env.example with any missing variables, writing
     the extracted default value when the author committed to one and
     falling back to a TODO placeholder otherwise (see rule below).
  3. Injects the load_dotenv() bootstrap snippet into the package __init__.py.
  4. Ensures python-dotenv>=1.0.0 is listed in pyproject.toml dependencies.
  5. Detects hardcoded model name strings and replaces them with
     bare os.getenv("MODEL_NAME") calls (no default argument).

Two hard rules the script NEVER breaks:

  (1) IDEMPOTENCY / USER-EDIT SAFETY FOR .env.example. Existing lines
      in .env.example are NEVER modified. If a variable is already
      declared — with any value, whether the skill wrote it on a previous
      run or the maintainer typed it — the skill skips it. Delete the
      line to force regeneration. This is what makes re-running the
      skill safe on a recipe whose maintainer has customised .env.example.

      When ADDING a new line, the writer uses the resolved default
      extracted from source (setdefault > getenv/environ.get fallback,
      alphabetical file tie-break). Placeholder-shaped values (e.g.
      "my-project-id", "changeme", "<...>") are downgraded to the TODO
      placeholder AND the source string is preserved in the marker
      comment so the maintainer sees what was in source and can fix it.
      Every generated line carries a ``# extracted-by:extract-env-vars``
      marker.

      Hardcoded model strings replaced in source ARE written as their
      actual value in .env.example (e.g. MODEL_NAME_GENERATED_1=
      gemini-3.5-flash) — same as before v2.

  (2) ADDITIVE-ONLY FOR PYTHON FILES. The script never writes new
      os.environ.setdefault(...) bootstrap lines into any Python file.
      Pre-existing os.environ.setdefault(...) or
      os.getenv("VAR", "default") calls that a recipe author wrote by
      hand are LEFT UNTOUCHED — the script's only writes to Python
      files are (a) the load_dotenv snippet, (b) trailing-import E402
      suppression, and (c) the model-literal replacement.

Rationale for the v2 change (extracting setdefault/getenv defaults instead
of always writing TODO): a value hidden inside a Python file that a user
must know about but has no reason to look at is, in practice, undocumented.
.env.example is the documented configuration surface. Surfacing what the
author already committed to in code makes the configuration discoverable
without inventing anything new — the value in source WAS the value; we're
only lifting it into view.

# Classification of existing entries in .env.example
#
# When re-running the skill against a recipe whose .env.example already has
# entries, we can't apply a blanket "if present, skip" rule — that would
# leave v1-era TODO placeholders in place forever, even after source-side
# defaults become available. But we also can't blanket-overwrite, because
# any line the maintainer typed by hand is theirs.
#
# So every existing entry is classified into one of these buckets. The
# writer's action table (see `update_env_example`) depends on the bucket
# AND on what the current source scan produced.
#
# Golden rule: fail closed. If we can't confidently prove a line was
# skill-authored (has our marker) OR is a bare v1 TODO with no user
# annotations, we treat it as USER_OWNED and leave it alone. The cost
# of a missed upgrade is small; the cost of clobbering user intent
# is unrecoverable without a git checkout.
