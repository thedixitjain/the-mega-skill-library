# Changelog

## [0.0.9] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Re-released skill metadata to run through the corrected normal tag publish pipeline without runtime changes.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Re-released skill metadata to publish through the updated ClawHub pipeline without runtime changes.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Re-released skill package with updated marketplace grouping and signed release trust artifacts for Vercel-compatible skill installation.
- Marked Clawtributor as a harness-neutral global skill for OpenClaw, NanoClaw, Hermes, and Picoclaw installer grouping.
- Removed OpenClaw CLI as a declared runtime requirement because reporting is manual, approval-gated, and not tied to an OpenClaw command path.
- Documented Vercel skills installer usage alongside the OpenClaw/ClawHub install path.
- Moved local report/state guidance to `~/.clawsec/clawtributor/`.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-05-14

### Security
- Added explicit signed release artifact verification instructions for standalone installs, including `checksums.json`, `checksums.sig`, `signing-public.pem`, archive hash verification, and `SKILL.md`/`skill.json` checksum checks.

All notable changes to Clawtributor will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Replaced release-artifact bootstrap instructions in `SKILL.md` with registry-based installation guidance.
- Switched submission instructions to manual browser-form workflow after explicit approval (no scripted CLI submission flow).
- Reduced declared runtime requirements to `openclaw` for the packaged skill guidance.

### Security

- Removed automatic remote-install and automated issue-submission guidance patterns that were being classified as suspicious.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Operational notes that describe the standalone install runtime and the external GitHub submission target.
- Metadata that records opt-in reporting, local state persistence, and approval-gated network egress.

### Changed

- Corrected the skill homepage in `SKILL.md` to the canonical `clawsec.prompt.security` domain.
- Declared the full standalone install/reporting toolchain (`bash`, `curl`, `jq`, `shasum`, `unzip`, `gh`) in metadata.

### Security

- Made the off-host reporting trust model explicit: every submission stays approval-gated and evidence must be sanitized before it is sent to GitHub.
