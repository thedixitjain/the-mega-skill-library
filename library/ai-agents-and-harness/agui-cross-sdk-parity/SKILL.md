# AG-UI Cross-SDK Parity

The .NET SDK implements an upstream, multi-language protocol. This skill encodes the
**parity process**: which SDK is authoritative, where its reference and fixtures live,
how to map reference concepts onto the .NET model, and how parity is guarded.

## Parity Principle

- **TypeScript is canonical** for wire format AND client run-loop behavior. When two
  SDKs disagree, match TS.
- **Python is types + encoder only.** It has `core` (types/events) and an `encoder`,
  but **no client run-loop and no protobuf** (`sdks/python/ag_ui/` has `core/` and
  `encoder/` but no `client/` or `proto/`). Use it only as a secondary check on
  type/JSON shape — never for run-loop or proto questions.
- Upstream protocol or SDK fixes (in the TS client run-loop, or in
  Microsoft.Extensions.AI / Microsoft Agent Framework) sometimes need a .NET
  counterpart; treat the TypeScript change as the contract to match.

## Where the Reference Lives

| Concern | TypeScript reference (source of truth) | .NET package it maps to |
|---|---|---|
| Event & type definitions | `sdks/typescript/packages/core/src/events.ts`, `types.ts`, `event-factories.ts` | `sdks/dotnet/src/AGUI.Abstractions/Events/`, `Messages/` |
| Client run-loop / transport | `sdks/typescript/packages/client/src/run/`, `apply/`, `agent/`, `transform/` | `sdks/dotnet/src/AGUI.Client/` (`AGUIChatClient.cs`, `AGUIHttpTransport.cs`, `EventStreamConverter.cs`, `ToolCallBuilder.cs`) |
| SSE / JSON wire framing | `sdks/typescript/packages/encoder/src/encoder.ts` | `sdks/dotnet/src/AGUI.Formatting/`, `AGUI.Abstractions/Serialization/` |
| Protobuf wire format | `sdks/typescript/packages/proto/src/proto/events.proto`, `types.proto`, `patch.proto` | `sdks/dotnet/src/AGUI.Protobuf/` (`ProtoEventMapper.cs`, `ProtoMessageMapper.cs`) |

The `src/` packages are **AGUI.Abstractions, AGUI.Formatting, AGUI.Protobuf, AGUI.Client,
AGUI.Server**; `sdks/dotnet/AGENTS.md` and `docs/architecture.md` are the canonical
description of the layout and conventions.

## Porting Workflow

1. **Locate the feature in TS.** Find the change in `packages/core` (a new event/type),
   `packages/client` (run-loop / event-application behavior), or
   `packages/proto`+`encoder` (wire framing). Read the TS implementation and its tests
   to capture the exact contract — field names, ordering, optionality, coalescing rules.
2. **Identify the wire contract.** Determine the JSON shape, the proto schema impact
   (if any), and whether client run-loop state changes. Cross-check the JSON property
   names against `packages/core/src/events.ts`.
3. **Map to the .NET model and the right package** (table above). Events/types →
   `AGUI.Abstractions`; run-loop → `AGUI.Client`; SSE/JSON framing → `AGUI.Formatting`;
   protobuf → `AGUI.Protobuf`. Follow the .NET conventions in `AGENTS.md` (one class
   per file, `sealed`, source-generated JSON context, `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt`).
4. **Implement** the .NET change. For a new event, follow the "Adding a new event type"
   checklist in `AGENTS.md` (class in `Events/`, `AGUIEventTypes` constant,
   `[JsonSerializable]`, `BaseEventJsonConverter` case, PublicAPI entry).
5. **Add parity assets** (see next section): a TS-produced JSON fixture under
   `tests/AGUI.Abstractions.UnitTests/Compatibility/` and/or a cross-language test in
   `tests/CrossLanguage.Vitest/tests/`.
6. **Verify byte/semantic parity** — run the compatibility and cross-language tests.
7. **Update docs.** Refresh `sdks/dotnet/AGENTS.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and
   `docs/cross-language-testing.md` if the change alters the model, package layout, or the
   set of wire-supported events.

## How Parity Is Guarded

Three independent layers catch drift; add to whichever layer the change touches.

- **Compatibility fixtures (catch JSON drift).**
  `tests/AGUI.Abstractions.UnitTests/Compatibility/` holds TS-produced JSON fixtures
  (`*-events.json`) loaded via `FixtureLoader` and deserialized into .NET types
  (`{Category}CompatibilityTest.cs`, e.g. `RunEventsCompatibilityTest`,
  `ToolCallEventsCompatibilityTest`). A new/changed event shape needs a fixture entry.
- **Cross-language tests (catch end-to-end drift).** The harness in
  `tests/CrossLanguage.TestServer/` (C# server) and `tests/CrossLanguage.Vitest/`
  (TS client driving it) proves real interop — see `sdks/dotnet/docs/cross-language-testing.md`.
  Scenario specs live in `tests/CrossLanguage.Vitest/tests/` (e.g.
  `parallel-tool-calls.test.ts`, `state-events.test.ts`, `protobuf-parity.test.ts`).
- **Protobuf byte-parity tests.** `protobuf-parity.test.ts` plus
  `tests/AGUI.Protobuf.UnitTests/` verify the binary encoding matches the TS proto output.

## Known Parity Boundary: Proto Is a Subset

The protobuf schema covers a **subset** of events by design. `.NET`-only events
(`Reasoning*`, `Activity*`, `ToolCallResult`) are not in the proto wire format and
**throw `NotSupportedException`** when mapped — see `ProtoEventMapper.cs` (the `default`
case lists the 16 supported events: RUN_STARTED/FINISHED/ERROR, STEP_STARTED/FINISHED,
TEXT_MESSAGE_START/CONTENT/END, TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END, STATE_SNAPSHOT/DELTA,
MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT, RAW, CUSTOM) and `ProtoMessageMapper.cs`. This is a **deliberate,
documented boundary** — do not "fix" it by inventing proto messages that don't exist in
`events.proto`. JSON/SSE remains the full-fidelity wire; protobuf is the constrained one.

## Critical Anti-patterns

1. **Never treat .NET as the source of truth.** If the .NET behavior differs from TS,
   the .NET side is the candidate for change — confirm against `packages/core` /
   `packages/client` first.
2. **Never consult Python for run-loop or proto parity.** Python has neither. Use it
   only as a type/JSON cross-check.
3. **Never add a proto mapping for a `.NET`-only event** (`Reasoning*`, `Activity*`,
   `ToolCallResult`). The `NotSupportedException` is intentional.
4. **Never land a wire change without a parity asset.** A JSON-shape change needs a
   Compatibility fixture; an interop/behavioral change needs a cross-language test.

## Routing to Sibling Skills

This skill governs *what* to port and *where the reference is* — delegate test
mechanics:

- **agui-dotnet-unit-tests** — serialization round-trips and Compatibility fixture tests.
- **agui-dotnet-integration-tests** — cross-language / E2E harness (TestServer + Vitest).
- **agui-dotnet-wire-types** — JSON/proto type and serialization-context rules.
- **agui-dotnet-transport** — SSE / HTTP transport details.
