# Adaptive Constraints (Nen-Free Zones)

## Problem

All missions load the same governance weight
regardless of complexity. Past 150 soft rules,
compliance drops for all rules. A focused 50-line
CLAUDE.md beats an unfocused 300-line one; bad
context performs worse than none. SWE-agent mini
proves 100 lines of focused code reaches 74% on
SWE-bench Verified. Simple tasks need less
governance, not the same governance.

## Constraint Profiles

| Profile | Task Type | Constraints Loaded | Governance |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Minimal | quickfix, single-file changes | Core safety only (no `--no-verify`, no secrets) | No war-room, no scope-guard, no plan review |
| Standard | tactical missions, multi-file | Core safety, scope-guard, and proof-of-work | Plan review, single checkpoint |
| Full | full/standard missions, architecture changes | All constraints, war-room, and extended thinking | Full checkpoints, iteration governor |

## Profile Selection

### By Mission Type

| Mission Type | Default Profile |
|-------------|----------------|
| `quickfix` | Minimal |
| `tactical` | Standard |
| `standard` | Full |
| `full` | Full |

### Manual Override

Override with `--constraints=minimal|standard|full`.
The override bypasses mission-type defaults and
risk upgrades (always wins).

### User Directive Override (Natural Language)

Parse the command-args and any free-text the user
provides at mission start. If a recognized trust
signal is present, treat it as a manual override
with the tier shown below. Directive overrides
behave exactly like `--constraints=` flags: they win
over mission-type defaults and risk upgrades, but
never bypass the Safety Floor.

| User phrase contains | Effective profile | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| "ignore scope guard" / "skip scope guard" | Standard with scope-guard stripped | Acts like Minimal for scope, keeps proof-of-work |
| "ultrathink" / "deep dive" / "be thorough" | Full quality, Minimal checkpoints | Use full reasoning depth, skip blocking gates |
| "don't ask" / "stop asking" / "no more questions" | Minimal | Auto-continue all phase transitions |
| "be autonomous" / "trust your judgment" | Minimal | Same as above |
| "I trust you" / "go ahead" / "just do it" | Minimal | Same as above |
| "ask before each step" / "supervised" | Full | Force maximum oversight |
| "explain everything" / "teach me" | Full and verbose | Pair with explanatory output style |

Match is case-insensitive substring. Multiple
matches: the most-restrictive directive wins (Full
beats Minimal). The orchestrator records the
matched directive and resulting profile in
`.attune/mission-state.json` under
`directive_override`:

```json
{
  "directive_override": {
    "matched_phrase": "ignore scope guard",
    "effective_profile": "standard_minus_scope_guard",
    "matched_at": "2026-04-25T17:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

When a directive override is detected, the
orchestrator MUST acknowledge it once at mission
start, then stop asking for the corresponding
checkpoints. Repeated approval-seeking after a
directive override is itself a workflow bug; see
`/sanctum:fix-workflow` retrospectives for examples.

#### What Directives Cannot Override

The Safety Floor below applies regardless of
directive. Even "trust me, just do it" cannot waive:

- Pre-commit hooks
- Proof-of-work evidence capture
- Destructive-operation confirmation (rm -rf, force
  push, DROP TABLE, branch deletion)
- External-facing actions (PR creation, issue
  comments, release tags)
- Cost threshold breaches (token/time budget exceeded)

When the orchestrator hits one of these even under
a Minimal directive override, it pauses. The
override gives autonomy on routine decisions; it
does not surrender oversight on irreversible ones.

#### Persistent vs Per-Mission Directives

Directive overrides apply for the current mission
only. They do not persist to subsequent missions.
For permanent autonomy escalation, the user should
either set the profile flag on each mission or
elevate skill trust tiers via repeated successful
runs (see `trust-tier.md`).

### Risk Upgrade

`leyline:risk-classification` can upgrade (never
downgrade) the profile:

| Risk Level | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| GREEN/YELLOW | Use mission-type default |
| ORANGE | Upgrade to Standard minimum |
| RED | Upgrade to Full |

Selection order: mission-type default, then risk
upgrade, then manual override.

## What Each Profile Strips

### Minimal (vs Full)

Stripped:

- scope-guard worthiness evaluation
- war-room checkpoint
- plan-review iteration loop
- backlog triage (issue creation from Out of Scope)
- additive-bias-defense check

Kept:

- proof-of-work evidence (always required)
- Iron Law enforcement (always active)
- Pre-commit hooks (always run)
- Destructive operation confirmation (always prompt)

### Standard (vs Full)

Stripped:

- war-room checkpoint
- additive-bias-defense audit
- Plan review limited to single pass (no iteration
  governor, no multi-round revision)

Kept:

- scope-guard worthiness evaluation
- proof-of-work evidence
- Single checkpoint per critical phase
- Pre-commit hooks
- Iron Law enforcement
- Destructive operation confirmation

## Safety Floor

These constraints are never stripped regardless of
profile, forming the absolute minimum governance:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** always run. No path through
   adaptive-constraints disables `--no-verify`
   protection.
2. **proof-of-work evidence** is always required.
   Every mission must produce verifiable artifacts.
3. **Hard vows from vow-enforcement** are always
   enforced. Soft vows may be relaxed by profile.
4. **Destructive operation confirmation** always
   prompts. No silent `rm -rf`, `git push --force`,
   or `DROP TABLE`.

Any code path bypassing the safety floor is a bug.
The floor is not configurable.

## Token Savings

| Profile | Modules Skipped | Tokens Saved |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Minimal | 4 (scope-guard, war-room, plan-review, additive-bias-defense) | ~2000 per mission |
| Standard | 2 (war-room, additive-bias-defense) | ~800 per mission |
| Full | 0 (baseline) | 0 |

Savings compound: 5 quickfixes save ~10k tokens.

## Integration with Phase Routing

The `phase-routing.md` module consults adaptive-
constraints before each phase transition:

1. At mission start, the orchestrator determines the
   constraint profile and records it in
   `.attune/mission-state.json` under
   `constraint_profile`.

2. Before each phase, phase-routing checks the
   active profile against the phase's governance
   requirements.

3. If the profile says "skip checkpoint for this
   phase," phase-routing auto-continues without
   presenting the checkpoint prompt.

4. The profile is locked at mission start. No mid-
   mission changes. If risk escalates, the
   orchestrator logs a warning; the user can abort
   and restart with a higher profile.

### Phase-Routing Decision Table

| Phase Transition | Minimal | Standard | Full |
|-----------------|---------|----------|------|
| brainstorm to specify | auto-continue | auto-continue | checkpoint |
| specify to plan | auto-continue | checkpoint | checkpoint and backlog triage |
| plan to execute | auto-continue | single-pass review | full review loop and war-room |
| post-execute | proof-of-work only | proof-of-work, scope check | proof-of-work, scope, and bias audit |
