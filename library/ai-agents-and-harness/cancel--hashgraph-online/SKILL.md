# Claude Code Cancel

Use this skill when the user wants to stop an active Claude Code job in this repository.

Resolve `<plugin-root>` as two directories above this `SKILL.md` file. Always run the companion from that active plugin root:
`node "<plugin-root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" cancel $ARGUMENTS`

Supported arguments: `[job-id]`

Output:
- Present the companion stdout exactly as returned.
- Do not add extra prose unless the command itself failed before producing output.
