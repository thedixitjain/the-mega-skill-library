# Changelog

## [0.0.7] - 2026-06-23

- Re-released skill metadata to run through the corrected normal tag publish pipeline without runtime changes.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Re-released skill metadata to publish through the updated ClawHub pipeline without runtime changes.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Re-released skill package with updated marketplace grouping and signed release trust artifacts for Vercel-compatible skill installation.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-06-07

### Security
- Replaced DAST target hook execution with static hook source inspection so scanner runs never import, transpile, or invoke untrusted handler code.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-05-13

### Changed
- Re-release skill payload metadata after excluding test-only files from release SBOMs and archives.

All notable changes to the ClawSec Scanner will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Replaced simulated DAST checks with real OpenClaw hook execution harness testing
- Updated DAST semantics so high-severity findings are emitted for actual hook execution failures/timeouts, not static payload pattern matches
- Reclassified DAST harness capability limitations (for example missing TypeScript compiler for `.ts` hooks) to `info` coverage findings instead of high severity
- Added DAST harness mode guard to prevent recursive scanner execution when hook handlers are tested in isolation

### Added

- New DAST helper executor script for isolated per-hook execution and timeout enforcement
- DAST harness regression tests covering no-false-positive baseline and malicious-input crash detection

## [0.0.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Initial release of ClawSec Scanner skill
- Automated vulnerability scanning for OpenClaw skill installations
- Integration with advisory feed for real-time security alerts
- Support for scanning skill dependencies and detecting known CVEs
- Configurable scan policies and risk thresholds
- Detailed vulnerability reporting with remediation guidance
