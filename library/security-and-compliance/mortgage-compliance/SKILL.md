# Mortgage Compliance

Strict mortgage regulatory compliance layer that ensures every response touching lending, rates, fees, qualifications, or loan terms complies with federal and state regulations.

## When to Use This Skill

- Presenting any rate quote or fee estimate to a borrower
- Answering questions about qualification, approval, or loan terms
- Handling borrower data and privacy concerns
- Verifying state licensing before quoting

## What This Skill Does

1. Enforces TRID (Loan Estimate timing, tolerance thresholds, Closing Disclosure requirements)
2. Prevents RESPA Section 8 violations (kickbacks, referral fees, unearned fees)
3. Ensures TILA compliance (APR disclosure, right of rescission, advertising rules)
4. Enforces ECOA / Fair Lending (prohibits questions about protected classes)
5. Validates state licensing (10 licensed states with specific license numbers)
6. Manages required disclosures at initial contact and quote presentation
7. Protects borrower data privacy (PII handling, SSN/DOB prohibition in chat)
