# Scope-Focused PR Review

Review pull/merge requests with discipline: validate against original requirements, prevent scope creep, and route out-of-scope findings to issues on the detected platform.

**Platform detection is automatic** via `leyline:git-platform`. Use `gh` for GitHub, `glab` for GitLab. Check session context for `git_platform:`.

## Core Principle

**A PR review validates scope compliance, not code perfection.**

The goal is to validate the implementation meets its stated requirements without introducing regressions. Improvements beyond the scope belong in future PRs.

## When To Use

- Before merging any feature branch
- When reviewing PRs from teammates
- To validate your own work before requesting review
- To generate a backlog of improvements discovered during review

## When NOT To Use

- Preparing PRs - use pr-prep instead
- Deep code
  review - use pensive:unified-review
- Preparing PRs - use pr-prep instead
- Deep code
  review - use pensive:unified-review

## Scope Classification Framework

Every finding must be classified:

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **BLOCKING** | Bug, security issue, or regression introduced by this change | Must fix before merge |
| **IN-SCOPE** | Issue directly related to stated requirements | Should address in this PR |
| **SUGGESTION** | Improvement within changed code, not required | Author decides |
| **BACKLOG** | Good idea but outside PR scope | Create GitHub issue |
| **IGNORE** | Nitpick, style preference, or not worth tracking | Skip entirely |

### Classification Examples

**BLOCKING:**
- Null pointer exception in new code path
- SQL injection in new endpoint
- Breaking change to public API without migration
- Test that was passing now fails

**IN-SCOPE:**
- Missing error handling specified in requirements
- Feature doesn't match spec behavior
- Incomplete implementation of planned functionality

**SUGGESTION:**
- Better variable name in changed function
- Slightly more efficient algorithm
- Additional edge case test

**BACKLOG:**
- Refactoring opportunity in adjacent code
- "While we're here" improvements
- Technical debt in files touched but not changed
- Features sparked by seeing the code

**IGNORE:**
- Personal style preferences
- Theoretical improvements with no practical impact
- Premature optimization suggestions

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Establish Scope Baseline

Before looking at ANY code, understand what this PR is supposed to accomplish.

**Note:** Version validation (Phase 1.5) runs AFTER scope establishment but BEFORE code review. See `modules/version-validation.md` for details.

**Search for scope artifacts in order:**

1. **Plan file**: Most authoritative (check spec-kit locations first, then root)
   ```bash
   # Spec-kit feature plans (preferred - structured implementation blueprints)
   find specs -name "plan.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs cat 2>/dev/null | head -100
   # Legacy/alternative locations
   ls docs/plans/ 2>/dev/null
   # Root plan.md (may be Claude Plan Mode artifact from v2.0.51+)
   cat plan.md 2>/dev/null | head -100
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

2. **Spec file**: Requirements definition (check spec-kit locations first)
   ```bash
   find specs -name "spec.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs cat 2>/dev/null | head -100
   cat spec.md 2>/dev/null | head -100
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

3. **Tasks file**: Implementation checklist (check spec-kit locations first)
   ```bash
   find specs -name "tasks.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs cat 2>/dev/null
   cat tasks.md 2>/dev/null
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

4. **PR/MR description**: Author's intent
   ```bash
   # GitHub
   gh pr view <number> --json body --jq '.body'
   # GitLab
   glab mr view <number> --json description --jq '.description'
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

5. **Commit messages**: Incremental decisions
   ```bash
   # GitHub
   gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[].messageHeadline'
   # GitLab
   glab mr view <number> --json commits
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

**Output:** A clear statement of scope:
> "This PR implements [feature X] as specified in plan.md. The requirements are:
> 1. [requirement]
> 2. [requirement]
> 3. [requirement]"

If no scope artifacts exist, flag this as a process issue but continue with PR description as the baseline.

### Phase 2: Gather Changes

```bash
# GitHub
gh pr diff <number> --name-only
gh pr diff <number>
gh pr view <number> --json additions,deletions,changedFiles,commits

# GitLab
glab mr diff <number>
glab mr view <number>
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

### Phase 3: Requirements Validation

Before detailed code review, check scope coverage:

- [ ] Each requirement has corresponding implementation
- [ ] No requirements are missing
- [ ] Implementation doesn't exceed requirements (overengineering signal)

### Phase 1.5: Version Validation (MANDATORY)

**Run version validation checks BEFORE code review.**

See `modules/version-validation.md` for detailed validation procedures.

**Quick reference:**
1. Check if bypass requested (`--skip-version-check`, label, or PR marker)
2. Detect if version files changed in PR diff
3. If changed, run project-specific validations:
   - Claude marketplace: Check marketplace.json vs plugin.json versions
   - Python: Check pyproject.toml vs __version__
   - Node: Check package.json vs package-lock.json
   - Rust: Check Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock
4. Validate CHANGELOG has entry for new version
5. Check README/docs for version references
6. Classify findings as BLOCKING (or WAIVED if bypassed)

**All version mismatches are BLOCKING unless explicitly waived by maintainer.**

### Phase 3.5: PR Hygiene Checks

Before diving into code, run the PR hygiene checks from
`modules/pr-hygiene.md`:

1. **Atomicity check**: Does this PR contain one logical
   change? Flag mixed commit types (feat, refactor, and fix),
   formatting commits bundled with logic, or changes spanning
   unrelated subsystems. Large PRs get 30% defect detection
   vs 75% for focused ones.

2. **Agent curation check**: Does the code show signs of
   iterative AI generation without a cleanup pass? Look for
   redundant implementations, premature abstractions, incomplete
   refactors, and scope drift.

3. **Self-review signals**: Are there unsquashed fixup commits,
   debug statements, or commented-out code that suggest the
   author did not read their own diff before sending?

Classify findings per `modules/pr-hygiene.md` severity tables.

### Phase 4: Code Review with Scope Context

Use `pensive:unified-review` on the changed files. For comment quality assessment, see `modules/comment-guidelines.md`.

**Critical:** Evaluate each finding against the scope baseline:

```text
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
Finding: "Function X lacks input validation"
Scope check: Is input validation mentioned in requirements?
  - YES → IN-SCOPE
  - NO, but it's a security issue → BLOCKING
  - NO, and it's a nice-to-have → BACKLOG
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

### Phase 4.5: Additive Bias Audit

Run `Skill(imbue:justify)` on the PR changes to detect
AI additive bias, test-logic tampering, and unnecessary
complexity.

**Key checks:**

1. **Additive bias score**: flag changes with high
   add/delete ratio (>5:1) that lack justification
2. **Iron Law compliance**: verify test assertions were
   not weakened to match broken implementations
3. **Minimal intervention**: confirm each changed file
   was necessary and the change was the smallest fix

**Classify justify findings using the scope framework:**

| Justify Signal | Likely Classification |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Test logic tampered | BLOCKING |
| High additive bias, no justification | IN-SCOPE |
| Premature abstraction | SUGGESTION |
| Compatibility shim | BACKLOG |

Include the additive bias score and Iron Law status in
the Phase 6 report.

### Phase 4.6: Invariant Conflict Detection

Check whether the PR touches existing design invariants.
This is a judgment problem that models get wrong far too
often: surface conflicts for human review rather than
silently accepting or rejecting them.

**Quick detection heuristic:**

1. Do changed files cross module boundaries that
   previously didn't interact?
2. Do changes introduce a new pattern alongside an
   existing one (two ways to do the same thing)?
3. Do interface/type/schema files change shape?
4. Do data flow directions change?
5. Are ADR-documented decisions being contradicted?

```bash
# Check for structural pattern changes
git diff --name-only HEAD...origin/master 2>/dev/null \
  | rg "(interface|types|schema|model|base|core|contract)" \
  || git diff --name-only HEAD...origin/master 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -E "(interface|types|schema|model|base|core|contract)"
```

**When a conflict is detected:**

Do NOT resolve it. Add to the report as a special
category:

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **INVARIANT** | Change conflicts with an existing design decision | Escalate to human with 3-option analysis |

**For each invariant conflict, present:**

1. **The invariant**: Name the design decision and why
   it was made (reference ADRs if available)
2. **The conflict**: What this PR does that clashes
3. **Option A, Preserve**: Don't merge this change;
   the invariant pays dividends elsewhere
4. **Option B, Layer**: Merge as-is, accepting
   inelegance; not every feature must be elegant
5. **Option C, Revise**: The invariant is wrong;
   here's what a redesign would look like

**Classification:** INVARIANT findings are always
BLOCKING, not because the code is wrong, but because
the judgment call requires human input. Only the human
reviewer can decide which of the three options is right.

**Why this matters:** Bad invariant decisions compound.
A few wrong calls and the codebase becomes unsalvageable.
This is not a context problem solvable with better
documentation: it is a judgment problem that requires
human wisdom.

### Phase 5: Backlog Triage

For each BACKLOG item, create an issue on the detected platform:

```bash
# GitHub
gh issue create \
  --title "[Tech Debt] Brief description" \
  --body "## Context
Identified during PR #<number> review.
..." \
  --label "tech-debt"

# GitLab
glab issue create \
  --title "[Tech Debt] Brief description" \
  --description "## Context
Identified during MR !<number> review.
..." \
  --label "tech-debt"
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

**Ask user before creating:** "I found N backlog items. Create issues? [y/n/select]"

### Phase 6: Generate Report

Structure the report by classification. Every BLOCKING and
IN-SCOPE finding MUST include educational insights per
`modules/educational-insights.md`: **Why** (the principle),
**Proof** (link to best practice), and a **Teachable Moment**
(generalized lesson). SUGGESTION findings include Why and
optionally Proof. BACKLOG items need only a brief rationale.

```markdown
## PR #X: Title

### Scope Compliance
**Requirements:** (from plan/spec)
1. [x] Requirement A - Implemented
2. [x] Requirement B - Implemented
3. [ ] Requirement C - **Missing**

### Blocking (1)
1. [B1] SQL injection via string concatenation
   - **Location**: `db/queries.py:89`
   - **Anchor**: `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = " + uid)`
   - **Issue**: User input interpolated directly into SQL
   - **Why**: String-interpolated SQL allows attackers to
     execute arbitrary queries (CWE-89). This is the #1
     web application vulnerability per OWASP Top 10.
   - **Proof**: [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
   - **Teachable Moment**: Always use parameterized queries
     or an ORM. This applies everywhere user input reaches
     a database, cache, or search engine query.
   - **Fix**: Use parameterized query:
     `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = ?", (uid,))`

### In-Scope (1)
1. [S1] Missing validation for edge case
   - **Location**: `api.py:45`
   - **Anchor**: `def handle_request(payload):`
   - **Issue**: Empty input not handled per requirement
   - **Why**: Defensive validation at API boundaries
     prevents cascading failures in downstream logic.
   - **Proof**: [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
   - **Teachable Moment**: Validate inputs at system
     boundaries (API handlers, CLI args, file parsers)
     but trust internal function contracts.

### Suggestions (1)
1. [G1] Consider extracting helper function
   - **Why**: The repeated pattern on lines 30-35 and
     72-77 violates DRY. Extracting it reduces future
     bug surface.
   - Author's discretion

### Backlog → GitHub Issues (3)
1. #142 - Refactor authentication module
2. #143 - Add caching layer
3. #144 - Update deprecated dependency

### Recommendation
**APPROVE WITH CHANGES**
Address B1 and S1 before merge.
```

### Local Output (`--local`)

When `--local [path]` is passed, write the Phase 6 report to a
local `.md` file instead of posting via API. Default path:
`.pr-review/pr-<number>-review.md`. The file includes the
review summary, test plan, and backlog items in a single
document. Issue creation and PR description updates are skipped.
Knowledge capture (Phase 7) still runs.

### Phase 7: Knowledge Capture

After generating the report, evaluate findings for knowledge capture into the project's review chamber.

**Trigger:** Automatically for findings scoring ≥60 on evaluation criteria.

```bash
# Capture significant findings to review-chamber
# Uses memory-palace:review-chamber evaluation framework
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

**Candidates for capture:**
- BLOCKING findings with architectural context → `decisions/`
- Recurring patterns seen in multiple PRs → `patterns/`
- Quality standards and conventions → `standards/`
- Post-mortem insights and learnings → `lessons/`

**Output:** Add to report:
```markdown
### Knowledge Captured 📚

| Entry ID | Title | Room |
|----------|-------|------|
| abc123 | JWT over sessions | decisions/ |
| def456 | Token refresh pattern | patterns/ |

View: `/review-room list --palace <project>`
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

See `modules/knowledge-capture.md` for full workflow.

## Quality Gates

A PR should be approved when:
- [ ] All stated requirements are implemented
- [ ] No BLOCKING issues remain
- [ ] IN-SCOPE issues are resolved or acknowledged
- [ ] BACKLOG items are tracked as GitHub issues
- [ ] Tests cover new code paths
- [ ] Tests would fail if the fix were reverted (the revert test)
- [ ] No obvious agent-generated code left uncurated
- [ ] Author can explain how each changed section works and how
      it could fail (understanding check, not just "tests pass")

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't: Scope Creep Review
> "While you're here, you should also refactor X, add feature Y, and fix Z in adjacent files."

**Do:** Create backlog issues, keep PR focused.

### Don't: Perfect is Enemy of Good
> "This works but could be 5% more efficient with different approach."

**Do:** If it meets requirements and has no bugs, it's ready.

### Don't: Blocking on Style
> "I prefer tabs over spaces."

**Do:** Use linters for style, reserve review for logic.

### Don't: Reviewing Unchanged Code
> "The file you imported from has some issues..."

**Do:** That's a separate PR. Create an issue if important.

### Don't: Tests That Prove Old Code Was Bad
> "Here's a test showing the old behavior was wrong."

**Do:** Write tests that break if your fix is reverted.
Tests should protect against regressions in *your* code,
not document why the change was needed. See
`modules/pr-hygiene.md` Principle 4.

### Don't: Bundling Unrelated Changes
> "I also reformatted the file and fixed a typo in another module."

**Do:** One PR = one logical change. Formatting, refactors,
and unrelated fixes belong in separate PRs. See
`modules/pr-hygiene.md` Principle 2.

### Don't: Merge Code You Cannot Explain

> "It works and the tests pass."

A PR where the author cannot explain how each changed section
works and how it might fail is not ready to merge. This is
especially true for AI-assisted code: generation speed creates
the illusion of understanding.

**Do:** Before marking a PR ready, ask the reviewing agent to
question you about the changed code: how each part works, what
assumptions it makes, and what inputs would break it. Continue
until you can answer without hesitation. Only merge code you
own front-to-back.

This applies to self-reviews: run the same probe before
requesting external review. Do not submit a PR for review that
you yourself do not fully understand.

### Verify Findings Are Grounded (`pr-review:findings-verified`)

Every finding must cite a real location and a verbatim anchor. Write
findings to `.review/findings.json` and confirm each citation resolves:

```bash
python plugins/imbue/scripts/citation_verifier.py \
  --findings .review/findings.json --repo-root .
```

Drop or label `UNVERIFIED` any finding the verifier fails (exit `1`); only
verified findings enter the report. See `Skill(imbue:review-core)` Step 5
and `Skill(imbue:structured-output)` for the schema.

## Integration with Other Tools

- **`/fix-pr`**: After review identifies issues, use this to address them
- **`/pr`**: To prepare a PR before review
- **`pensive:unified-review`**: For the actual code analysis
- **`pensive:bug-review`**: For deeper bug hunting if needed
- **`scribe:slop-detector`**: For documentation AND commit message quality analysis
- **`scribe:doc-generator`**: For PR description writing guidelines (slop-free)

## Slop Detection Integration

### Documentation Review
For all changed `.md` files, invoke `Skill(scribe:slop-detector)`:
- Score ≥ 3.0: Flag as IN-SCOPE (should remediate)
- Score ≥ 5.0: Flag as BLOCKING if `--strict` mode

### Commit Message Review
Scan all PR commit messages for slop markers:
```bash
gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[].messageBody' | \
  grep -iE 'leverage|seamless|comprehensive|delve|robust|utilize|facilitate'
```
If slop found in commits: Add to SUGGESTION category with remediation guidance.

### PR Description Review
Apply `scribe:slop-detector` to PR body:
- Tier 1 words in description → SUGGESTION to rephrase
- Marketing phrases ("unlock potential") → Flag for removal

## Exit Criteria

- Scope baseline established
- All changes reviewed against scope
- Findings classified correctly
- Backlog items tracked as issues
- Clear recommendation provided
- Every BLOCKING and IN-SCOPE finding carries a `Location` (file:line) and
  verbatim `Anchor`; `citation_verifier.py` confirmed all citations
  (exit `0`) or unverified findings are dropped/labeled `UNVERIFIED`

## Supporting Modules

- [GitHub PR comment patterns](modules/github-comments.md) - `gh api` patterns for inline and summary PR comments
