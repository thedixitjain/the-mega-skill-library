# OSINT Methodology — External Red-Team Edition

## 0. When to Use / When NOT

**Use this skill when:** planning or executing authorized external recon (red team, bug bounty, ASM); mapping an org's attack surface; investigating a person/entity/threat-actor; producing client deliverables.

**Do NOT use this skill when:** the user needs active exploitation, post-exploitation, or malware dev; blue-team/detection content; or the target's authorization is unclear — surface the scope question first.

---

## 1. Authorization & Legal Posture

Intended for assets the operator owns or has **written authorization** to assess.

**Soft scope check** — when authorization isn't established, ask once:
> *"Quick scope check: is this a target you own or have written authorization to assess? I want to make sure we stay on the right side of the engagement boundary."*

Once asserted, don't re-ask. If the engagement type is stated ("pentest of acme.com under contract"), proceed.

**Always-on guardrails:**
- Never weaken auth, rate limits, or safety controls on the target side.
- No destructive probes (SYN scans at line-rate, masscan, fuzzing) outside explicit `--aggressive` mode.
- Never paste real PII, credentials, session tokens, or API keys into cloud-hosted LLMs.
- Never act against assets outside documented scope, even "obviously related" ones.

---

## 2. Confidence Levels

Every assertion carries a confidence level.

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TENTATIVE** | Plausible from indirect evidence; unverified. Snippet-only dork match, email pattern inferred from name, single passive-source subdomain. |
| **FIRM** | Directly observed, uncorroborated. Subdomain resolves; Shodan banner returned; CT-log entry. |
| **CONFIRMED** | Multiple independent corroborations OR directly verified. Live-validated token; bucket listable; three-source subdomain convergence. |

**Rule of three for attribution:** 3 independent weak signals, OR 1 strong + 1 weak. Never single-source attribute.

### 2.1 Confidence Upgrade Workflows

| Asset type | TENTATIVE → FIRM | FIRM → CONFIRMED |
|---|---|---|
| Subdomain | ≥2 passive sources OR DNS resolves | Serves on a standard port AND banner/cert returned |
| IP | ≥2 sources (passive DNS, ASN, Shodan) | TCP SYN-ACK or ICMP reply |
| WebApp | URL extracted but not yet hit | HTTP returns 2xx/3xx/4xx AND content-length > 0 |
| Email | Name-pattern inferred OR snippet-only | Listed in Hunter/IntelX/breach, OR SMTP 250 (abort at DATA) |
| Bucket | Permutation candidate + HEAD returns 200/301/403 (exists) | GET listing = CONFIRMED |
| Credential / secret | Regex match in captured text | Read-only validator returns success (scope + account-ID documented) |
| Person | Name from single source | Confirmed by second independent source |
| SSO tenant | OIDC discovery endpoint returns metadata | Tenant GUID extracted AND domain ties back via MX/autodiscover/SP record |

Default reporting posture: never claim CONFIRMED without explicit corroboration. When in doubt, downgrade.

---

## 3. Output Format

Each finding uses this schema (drops cleanly into asset-management tools):

```
Finding:
  id:          <stable hash or UUID>
  module:      <technique that discovered it>
  asset_key:   <typed key, e.g. sub:api.example.com>
  category:    <e.g. SECRET_LEAK, OPEN_GRAPHQL_API, SSO_EXPOSURE>
  severity:    <info|low|medium|high|critical>
  confidence:  <tentative|firm|confirmed>
  title:       <one-line summary>
  description: <2-5 sentences>
  evidence:
    url:       <where found>
    timestamp: <UTC ISO8601>
    sha256:    <hash of any downloaded artifact>
    raw:       <truncated to 2 KiB>
  references:  [<CVE-ID, advisory URL, vendor doc>]
  remediation: <action the asset owner can take>
```

Always use UTC timestamps.

---

## 4. Source Hygiene & Citations

For every artifact: **URL + UTC timestamp + SHA-256 + tool version + run_id**.

- Hash all downloads with SHA-256. Screenshot in PNG.
- Raw HTTP captures capped at 2 KiB body. JSONL logs, one line per event.
- Separate evidence read-only from working copies; never edit captured artifacts.
- Prefer durable references (CVE, ATT&CK technique ID, RFC). If ephemeral, archive first (archive.today, Wayback SavePageNow).

---

## 5. Do NOT

- Do NOT paste creds, session tokens, real PII, or unique pivots into cloud LLMs. Use local models for sensitive analysis.
- Do NOT assume vendor labels are ground truth (TRM, Chainalysis, Arkham can disagree).
- Do NOT assert ownership from a single signal (favicon hash, shared NS, shared CT issuer — each is a hypothesis).
- Do NOT run fuzzing, SYN scans, masscan, or `nuclei fuzzing/*` outside explicit `--aggressive` mode.
- Do NOT use a credential validator for anything except read-only verification.
- Do NOT mirror-image the threat actor. Separate capability from intent and sponsorship.
- Do NOT escalate when you hit active defenses — back off and document (§6.4).

---

## 6. OpSec

### 6.1 Sock Puppets

Build posting history, age the account, use a separate browser profile. Persona generation: Fake Name Generator, This Person Does Not Exist. Browser isolation: Firefox Multi-Account Containers. Disposable numbers for SMS verification. Audit every extension before install. Maintain chain-of-custody: timestamp every action, hash every artifact.

### 6.2 Detectability Tagging

Tag every operation so you can reason about the trail you leave.

| Tag | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Low** | Passive Shodan InternetDB; crt.sh; Wayback CDX; SecurityTrails PDNS; Hunter.io; HTTP HEAD on public buckets; `getuserrealm.srf`; OIDC metadata fetch. |
| **Medium** | `GetCredentialType` user-enum; Okta `/api/v1/authn` user-enum; credential validation; AWS `sts:GetCallerIdentity`; Swagger/GraphQL probes; targeted favicon-hash + JARM fingerprinting. |
| **High** | Active port scans (naabu/masscan/nmap); Nuclei full runs against production; subdomain brute-force at scale; SMTP `RCPT TO` enum; web fuzzing. |

Defaults: passive by default. Active probes only when (a) explicitly authorized, (b) within agreed windows, (c) operator aware of log volume.

### 6.3 Validator Discipline

When you find a credential in the wild, confirm liveness with **read-only validators only** (`/me`, `auth.test`, `sts:GetCallerIdentity`). Never create, modify, delete, or send. Record `checked_at` UTC + truncated response + scope/account-ID. Concrete validator endpoints for 9 providers live in `offensive-osint` §23.

### 6.4 Detection-Aware Probing

**Signs you've been detected (escalating severity):** 429 / `Retry-After`; captcha interstitials; WAF block page; status-code drift (200→403 from your IP only); banner change; NXDOMAIN rollback; honeypot bait (credentials that don't validate); direct contact.

**Back-off ladder:**
1. Halve concurrency; add 2–10s jitter.
2. Stop hitting the triggering path; pivot to a different module.
3. New User-Agent / TLS fingerprint.
4. Rotate egress IP (residential proxy, different cloud region).
5. Pause 1–24 hours.
6. If WAF block / status drift / direct contact: **stop and consult the engagement lead.**

---

## 7. External Red-Team Recon Pipeline

Five sequential stages; modules within a stage can run concurrently.

| Stage | What you do |
|---|---|
| **1 — Seed Discovery** | WHOIS, ASN enum (HE BGP Toolkit, RIPEstat), DNS records (A/AAAA/MX/TXT/NS/SOA/CAA), CT history (crt.sh, Censys). |
| **2 — Asset Expansion** | Subdomain enum (passive first → permutations → brute); cloud bucket permutation; typosquat generation; Wayback CDX; mobile app discovery; DNS walking; LinkedIn employee enum. |
| **3 — Enrichment** | Port/service (Shodan InternetDB → naabu); TLS handshakes (cert chain, JARM, favicon mmh3); WAF/CDN inference; origin discovery; security headers; email harvest; email security audit; GitHub dorking; JS deep analysis; SSO/IdP fingerprinting; API discovery; secrets sweep (Postman, Stack Exchange); vendor product fingerprinting; container/CI-CD/cloud-native exposure; job posting harvest. |
| **4 — Exposure Analysis** | Nuclei always-on checks; TLS deep audit; breach × identity correlation → SSO_EXPOSURE findings; targeted misconfig probes (`.git/config`, `.env`, `/actuator/env`, `/_cat/indices`, `/console`); vulnerability prioritization (CVE × EPSS × KEV × POC). |
| **5 — Reporting** | Risk scoring per finding; asset graph export; client-facing report (exec summary + technical detail + remediation); reproduction package; bug bounty submission if applicable. |

### 7.1 Pipeline Priority Order (highest signal density first)

1. **Breaches** — HudsonRock Cavalier + HIBP + DeHashed. Highest ROI; often yields plaintext corp SSO creds.
2. **GitHub recon** — code-search dorks. Fastest path to AWS keys, Slack tokens, JWT secrets.
3. **Nuclei misconfig sweep** — exposed admin panels, CVEs with public POCs.
4. **Cloud buckets** — listable = CRITICAL.
5. **Ports** — Shodan InternetDB first. VPN concentrators, RDP, Jenkins, Elasticsearch are high-value pivots.
6. **Email OSINT** — feeds breaches; feeds phishing list.
7. **Web tech / WAF / screenshots** — triage thousands of hosts.
8. **Wayback** — archived JS for hard-coded keys; removed admin/dev paths.
9. **DNS deep + email security** — SPF/DMARC gaps enable spoofing; TXT tokens reveal SaaS tenancies.
10. **Certificates → TLS** — CT timeline catches forgotten subdomains; weak ciphers = cheap findings.
11. **ASN + reverse DNS** — corporate IP space hosts unadvertised infra.
12. **Typosquats** — registered = finding; unregistered = phishing shortlist.

### 7.2 Time Budgeting & Engagement Profiles

| Stage | Small org (<100) | Medium (100–1K) | Large (1K+) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Seed | 30 min | 30 min | 30 min |
| 2. Asset expansion | 1–2 h | 2–4 h | 4–8 h |
| 3. Enrichment (per 100 alive webapps) | ~1 h | ~1 h | ~1 h |
| 4. Exposure analysis | 1–3 h | 3–6 h | 6–12 h |
| 5. Reporting | 2–4 h | 4–8 h | 1–2 days |

**Profiles:** 1-hour rapid (Stages 1–2 passive + breach + exec summary) · 4-hour focused (adds email harvest, SSO fingerprinting, typosquats) · 1-day standard (full Stages 1–4 in priority order) · 1-week deep (all of standard + JS deep, mobile, cloud-native, vendor product, package registry) · ongoing weekly diff (re-run Stages 1–3, diff against baseline).

**Abort conditions:** scope mismatch after Stage 1; near-zero attack surface after Stage 2; WAF/detection signs hit during any stage (§6.4).

---

## 8. Asset Graph Discipline

Every discovery is a **typed asset** in a graph, not a free-floating string.

### 8.1 Asset Taxonomy

| Category | Types |
|---|---|
| DNS / Network | `domain`, `subdomain`, `ip`, `netblock`, `asn` |
| Service | `port`, `service`, `certificate` |
| Identity | `email`, `person`, `credential` |
| Code / Config | `repo`, `secret` |
| Cloud / Storage | `bucket`, `firebase_project` |
| Web | `webapp`, `wayback_endpoint`, `api_endpoint`, `api_spec`, `graphql_schema` |
| Mobile | `mobile_app`, `deep_link`, `exported_component` |
| Phishing | `typosquat_domain` |
| SaaS | `postman_collection`, `postman_workspace`, `postman_api_key`, `stack_post`, `saas_public_surface` |

Every asset carries: `type`, `key` (typed dedup id), `value`, `sources[]`, `confidence`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `attrs{}`.

**Discipline:** create the asset first, then attach the finding. Dedup by key. `sources[]` must list every source. Confidence is per-source, then aggregated.

### 8.2 Asset-Level Triage Rules

**WebApp priority (highest first):** auth (`auth.`, `login.`, `sso.`) → admin paths → dev/staging hosts → API (`api.`, `gateway.`) → customer-facing (`portal.`, `app.`) → marketing.

**Email priority:** exec (CEO/CFO/CISO) → IT/helpdesk/security → dev/engineer/DBA → sales/HR/finance → generic role accounts.

**Repo priority:** recently pushed (last 30 days) > stale; public with target name in description > code-only; mentions `prod`/`internal`/`secret` in name → HIGH priority despite being public.

---

## 9. Findings Rubric & Severity Mapping

### Severity Anchors

| Severity | Anchor |
|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Pre-auth code execution; confirmed valid credentials; listable production data; fundamental trust violations. Examples: `.env` exposed, listable S3 bucket with PII, live-validated AWS admin key, open Kubernetes API with anon-auth, ≥10 employees in breach corpus + tenant identified. |
| **HIGH** | Significant exposure with clear escalation path; high-value info disclosure. Examples: public secret in GitHub repo, subdomain takeover possible, reflected CORS with credentials, exposed Jenkins/phpMyAdmin admin UI, open GraphQL introspection on prod, DMARC `p=none`. |
| **MEDIUM** | Info disclosure, hardening gaps, brute-force exposure. Examples: missing HSTS/CSP, Apache `/server-status`, internal IP/hostname in JS, schema leakage in error pages, `android:allowBackup=true`, wildcard CORS on user-data API, Slack webhook leaked. |
| **LOW** | Cosmetic or marginal gaps. Examples: missing `X-Frame-Options`, `.DS_Store` exposed, Stripe **test** key, cert pinning missing, outdated WordPress (no known active exploit). |
| **INFO** | Worth recording; no immediate action. Examples: `robots.txt` reveals paths, private bucket locked down, DNSSEC not enabled. |

### Severity Escalation Rules

- HSTS missing on auth/login/SSO/admin path → **MED → HIGH**.
- Wildcard CORS + credentials header → **MED → HIGH**.
- Endpoint interest score ≥70 (companion skill §20) → at least **HIGH**.
- Domain breach ≥10 employees → **CRITICAL** regardless of stale-data caveats.
- Vendor product version matches CISA KEV → **CRITICAL**.

---

## 10. Pivot Modes & Scale Tactics

| Aspect | Investigative Mode | Offensive Recon Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Probing rate | Slow, single-threaded, blends with traffic | Bursts, parallel, rate-limited per provider |
| OpSec posture | Sock-puppet only; never reveal investigator | Engagement persona; team may notify SOC |
| Evidence handling | Court-grade chain of custody | Engagement-grade; same hash/timestamp discipline |
| Reporting format | Narrative + sourced timeline | Per-asset findings + remediation + reproduction |

**Scale tactics:**
- **Small (<100):** Individual-account focus. One exec/CFO compromise often hands you the keys. Deep on every email + every identity-fabric finding. Check founders' personal GitHub orgs.
- **Medium (100–1K):** Balanced enumeration. Full pipeline at standard depth. LinkedIn priority by role. Check both app stores.
- **Large (1K–10K):** Breadth-first; automation for asset discovery; manual triage on findings only.
- **Very large / conglomerate:** Scope pruning is the most important step. Brand-pivot map first. Breach corpus and systemic posture findings (DMARC gaps, SSO_EXPOSURE breadth) dominate over individual accounts.

## 11. Implementation: Companion Skill Pointers

The following modules have full implementation detail — probe paths, wordlists, curl one-liners, regexes, and scoring rubrics — in `offensive-osint`. This skill defines *what to do*; that skill defines *how to do it*.

**Identity Fabric Mapping** (`offensive-osint` §22) — Microsoft Entra (OIDC metadata, getuserrealm.srf, GetCredentialType), Okta (slug derivation, /api/v1/authn), ADFS, Google Workspace, generic OIDC (Auth0/Keycloak/Ping/OneLogin/Duo), SAML metadata (5 paths), AWS account-ID extraction, M365 deep surface (Teams federation, SharePoint, OneDrive, OAuth client_id, device-code phishing check, Power Platform).

**API & Auth-Map** (`offensive-osint` §16.1–16.2, §20) — 28-path Swagger/OpenAPI wordlist; 13-path GraphQL wordlist; introspection POST body; field-suggestion enumeration when introspection disabled; endpoint interest score 0–100 rubric.

**JavaScript Deep Analysis** (`offensive-osint` §13 pattern) — sourcemap detection; secret catalog over JS bodies and `sourcesContent[]`; three-tier endpoint-extraction regex; internal-host leakage patterns; Next.js manifest parsing.

**Mobile Attack Surface** (`offensive-osint` §21) — Android/iOS app discovery; ownership confidence 0–100 scoring; APK static analysis; manifest misconfig findings; Firebase canonical probe.

**Cloud Attack Surface** (`offensive-osint` §16.8) — S3/GCS/Azure bucket permutation (6 prefixes × 15 suffixes); HEAD → GET probe technique; cloud-native fingerprints (Lambda, Cloud Run, Azure Functions, Vercel, Netlify, Workers); K8s/etcd/kubelet/container registry exposure.

**WAF / CDN Bypass & Origin Discovery** (`offensive-osint` §16.15) — DNS history pivot; cert SAN pivot; favicon mmh3 + JARM clustering; direct IP probe with Host header; mail/ftp/cpanel exception; error page leakage; email-header bounce trick; confidence rules.

**Vulnerability Prioritization** (`offensive-osint` §29.2) — NVD, EPSS, CISA KEV, ExploitDB, Metasploit, InTheWild.io, Trickest CVE→POC; 9-signal scoring rubric → P0/P1/P2/P3 tiers.

**Phishing Infrastructure** (`offensive-osint` §16.14 for email security) — typosquat shortlists via dnstwist; subdomain takeover for trusted-domain phishing; email spoof feasibility matrix (SPF × DMARC); pretext development from OSINT (job titles, recent events, vendor relationships, GitHub commits).

---

## 12. Breach × Identity Correlation

Highest-ROI single technique for external red teams. Run on every engagement.

| Source | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hudson Rock Cavalier | FREE | Infostealer-log corpus; very high signal for corp SSO creds. |
| Have I Been Pwned | Free + paid | Domain-wide existence + Pwned Passwords (k-anonymity). |
| DeHashed | Paid | Per-record searchable API. |
| IntelX | Free + paid | Aggregator; phonebook search. |

**Domain-level severity:** ≥10 employees compromised → CRITICAL; 1–9 → HIGH; ≥1 end-user → MEDIUM; domain seen with 0 named accounts → INFO.

**SSO_EXPOSURE:** after Stage 3 identity-fabric mapping AND breach lookups, intersect discovered IdP tenant domain with breach corpus. Non-empty intersection → `SSO_EXPOSURE` finding, severity CRITICAL. Evidence: tenant ID + product + employee count + per-account source.

**Stealer log discipline:** encrypt at rest; SHA-256 every artifact; never paste plaintext passwords into cloud LLMs; maintain chain of custody; redact passwords in client reports by default (offer encrypted credential bundle separately).

---

## 13. Specialty OSINT Domains

**Cryptocurrency** — track flows with Cielo, TRM, Arkham, MetaSleuth. L2/rollup: start at L1 bridge events; use L2 explorers for in-rollup activity. Caution: bridges mint/burn (avoid 1:1 flow assumptions); MEV paths create false direct trails.

**Image / Video / Chronolocation** — reverse image search (Google Lens, Yandex, TinEye); EXIF via ExifTool; forensics via Forensically/FotoForensics; geolocation via foreground+background landmark analysis, Street View, Overpass Turbo, PeakVisor. Shadow analysis: SunCalc, ShadeMap. Satellite: Google Earth Pro historical, Sentinel Hub.

**Threat Actor Investigation** — scoping: actor hypothesis from CERT/vendor reports → IOC harvest → infra mapping via CT log pivots, shared hosting, NS reuse, HTML fingerprints → artifact profiling (PDB paths, Rich headers, SSDEEP/YARA) → social pivots (handles, code snippets, job posts). Attribution discipline: rule of three; separate capability from intent; prefer durable pivots (code-signing certs, build path idioms) over ephemeral (resolving IPs). Russia pivots: EGRUL, Rusprofile, hh.ru, VKontakte. China pivots: gsxt.gov.cn, Tianyancha, ICP filings, Weibo, Zhihu.

**People & Social Media** — username enumeration: WhatsMyName, Sherlock, Maigret. Face search: PimEyes, Exposing.ai. Social graph: Maltego, SocialBlade. Bluesky: DID resolution via `bsky.social/xrpc/`, firehose via Firesky. Mastodon: WebFinger discovery; FediSearch cross-instance.

---

## 14. Anti-Patterns & Common Failure Modes

- **Single-source attribution.** Rule of three.
- **Trusting vendor labels as ground truth.** Labels are hypotheses.
- **Favicon-hash = ownership.** Shared infra, shared CMS, shared CDN all produce matches.
- **Snippet-only dork as CONFIRMED.** TENTATIVE until visited.
- **Pasting real PII / creds into cloud LLMs.** Local models only.
- **Mirror-imaging the threat actor.** They don't think like you.
- **Attribution by IP geolocation.** VPNs and residential proxies exist.
- **Ignoring CT-log lag.** Absence ≠ doesn't exist; lag can be minutes to hours.
- **Counting Wayback as "the site at time T."** Best-effort; many requests fail.
- **Letting the asset graph carry untyped strings.** Every discovery is an asset.
- **Skipping the scope check.** Ask once when in doubt.
- **Forgetting UTC.** Local time creates correlation bugs.
- **Continuing to probe after a WAF block.** Back off (§6.4).
- **Skipping confidence-upgrade documentation.** TENTATIVE needs a path to CONFIRMED.
- **Treating exec-summary as an afterthought.** Plan deliverables at engagement start.

---

## 15. Bug Bounty Submission & Responsible Disclosure

**Platforms:** HackerOne (CVSS-based) · Bugcrowd (VRT: P1–P5) · Intigriti · YesWeHack · HackenProof (crypto-focused) · Open Bug Bounty (XSS/SSRF only) · `/.well-known/security.txt` for unprogrammed targets.

**Report structure:**
```
Title: [Severity] [Component] Brief description
Summary: 2-3 sentences — what and why it matters.
Steps to Reproduce: numbered, copy-pasteable, URL + payload + expected vs actual.
Proof of Concept: screenshot or sanitized HTTP request/response.
Impact: what data/users/functions are at risk.
Severity: CVSS v3 vector + score + 1-sentence justification.
Remediation: concrete, actionable recommendation.
```

**Unprogrammed CVD:** check `security.txt` → `security@<target>` → WHOIS abuse contact → CERT/CC. Standard 90-day window before public release. **Never:** include others' PII, post publicly before window expires, or escalate via social media first.

---

## 16. Client Deliverable Templates

**Executive summary structure:** engagement metadata → top 3–5 findings (title + business impact + remediation effort) → postural observations (email security, identity fabric, cloud surface, mobile) → aggregate metrics (assets, findings by severity, live creds confirmed) → recommended next steps with timeline.

**Per-finding report card:** title + severity + confidence + asset key + UTC timestamp → description → evidence (URL + tool + screenshot + raw HTTP + SHA-256) → reproduction steps → business-language impact → remediation (immediate / short-term / long-term) → references + attack-path hint.

**Risk translation (sample):**

| Technical | Business language |
|---|---|
| Listable S3 bucket with PII | Customer records publicly downloadable. Potential GDPR/CCPA notification trigger. |
| Exposed `.env` with DB credentials | Full database access; pivots to backups, billing, employee PII. |
| Live AWS admin key | Complete cloud compromise; cryptominer spin-up, full data exfiltration, lateral movement. |
| DMARC `p=none` | Anyone on the internet can send email appearing to be from your domain. |
| ≥10 employees in breach corpus | Stolen corp SSO credentials circulating; active credential-stuffing risk. |
| Vendor appliance on CISA KEV | Attackers are actively scanning the internet for this exact issue. Patch now. |

**Reporting cadence:** Day 1 EOD kickoff summary → mid-engagement heads-up on first CRITICAL → end-of-engagement preliminary (top 5 findings) → final report within agreed SLA → re-test offer for CRITICAL/HIGH findings post-remediation.

**Reproduction package:** `run-log.jsonl` + `assets.db` + `findings.db` + `evidence/` (screenshots, HTTP captures, downloads with `.sha256`) + `re-test-script.sh` + engagement metadata.
