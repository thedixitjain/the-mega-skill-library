# EACL Workflow

Use this as the project-management skill for an EACL submission. EACL is a conference routed
through ACL Rolling Review: it has no standing editor-in-chief and no article-processing charge.
The rotating leadership is the per-edition General Chair and Program Chairs (EACL 2027: General
Chair Isabelle Augenstein; Program Chairs Malvina Nissim, Roi Reichart, Sara Tonelli — verified
2026-07-09). The cost model is registration; the Anthology is open access with no author fee.
Replace every date below with the current official timetable.

## The single-cycle calendar (EACL 2027 anchor)

Because EACL 2027 sits early in the year, the organizers named **one viable ARR cycle** — there
is **no fallback**. That reshapes planning around a single hard gate:

| Milestone | EACL 2027 anchor date | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| ARR submission (only cycle) | August 3, 2026 | ARR |
| Rebuttal window | in-cycle (待核实 exact dates) | Authors |
| Meta-review | in-cycle | Action editor |
| Commitment to EACL | October 11, 2026 | Authors |
| Notification | November 12, 2026 | EACL |
| Camera-ready | November 26, 2026 | Authors |
| Conference | March 9-14, 2027, Athens | EACL |

All ARR/commitment deadlines run anywhere-on-Earth; confirm exact times on the live pages.

## Backward-planning offsets

```text
Work backwards from the single ARR deadline (D):
  D-8 weeks: freeze scope; lock experiments (eacl-experiments)
  D-6 weeks: first full draft; run the worked-example arc (eacl-writing-style)
  D-4 weeks: related-work freshness sweep (eacl-related-work)
  D-3 weeks: reproducibility + artifact packaging (eacl-reproducibility, eacl-artifact-evaluation)
  D-2 weeks: Limitations + supplementary placement (eacl-supplementary)
  D-1 week:  checklist, anonymization, page count (eacl-submission)
  D-3 days:  smoke-check archive; submit early
```

## Plan the fallback that is not a next cycle

- The usual *ACL "resubmit next cycle" safety net **does not exist** for a single-cycle EACL
  edition. Before the deadline, decide the **re-route plan**: if the paper misses or is rejected,
  which sibling venue (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, AACL) is next, and the ARR reviews travel with it.
- This makes the submit-thin-or-wait decision from `eacl-submission` a real fork — resolve it
  early, not on deadline night.

## At each gate

- **Submission:** run `eacl-submission`; there is no second attempt this edition.
- **Rebuttal:** run `eacl-author-response`; fix what fits the window because you cannot defer.
- **Commitment:** run `eacl-review-process`; weigh main vs Findings vs re-route.
- **Camera-ready:** run `eacl-camera-ready`; author list is frozen from commitment.

## Cadence caution

- EACL does not run every year and its calendar slot moves; do **not** carry the 2027 timing to
  another edition. Confirm the edition exists and reopen its CFP before planning.

## Output format

```text
[Timeline] <backward-planned dates from the single ARR deadline>
[Single-cycle risk] <readiness for the one gate>
[Rebuttal plan] <what can be fixed in-window>
[Commitment decision] <main / Findings / re-route>
[Re-route fallback] <named sibling venue + ARR-review carry-forward>
[Camera-ready + logistics] <deadlines, registration, presentation>
```
