# JFQA Contribution Framing (jfqa-contribution-framing)

Use this skill to state the contribution of a **JFQA** manuscript crisply — the journal is highly selective (prints **< 9%** of 1,000+ annual submissions) and imposes an unusually strict abstract limit.

## The 100-word abstract (hard constraint)

JFQA requires the abstract to be **one paragraph of no more than 100 words** — tighter than most finance/economics flagships. Make every word count:

- One sentence on the question and why it matters in finance.
- One or two sentences on the data/design (sample, identification).
- One or two sentences on the headline quantitative result, **with a number** (basis points, alpha, elasticity, magnitude per one-SD change).
- One sentence on the broader implication for the subfield.
- No citations, no equations, no filler. Stay at or under 100 words.

## The introduction contribution paragraph

- Lead with the question and the answer; do not bury the result.
- State the contribution against the closest rivals (see jfqa-literature-positioning).
- Make the **economic magnitude** explicit and the mechanism clear.
- Preview the design and the key exhibit.

## Anti-patterns

- An abstract over 100 words, or split into multiple paragraphs — a formatting strike before a reviewer even reads it.
- Vague claims ("we shed light on...") instead of a measured result.
- Over-claiming beyond what the design supports.
- Saving the contribution for the conclusion.

## JFQA contribution stress test

Before accepting the framing, force the abstract and first-page contribution paragraph to answer:

1. **Finance object**: return, risk, liquidity, capital structure, governance, intermediary behavior, or
   another finance quantity that JFQA readers recognize immediately.
2. **Design credibility**: the source of variation, model restriction, or quantitative method that makes
   the claim more than a finance correlation.
3. **Magnitude**: basis points, alpha, spread, elasticity, valuation effect, probability change, or another
   finance-scale number.
4. **Closest-rival delta**: the one paper a referee will cite and the precise way this paper changes the
   conclusion.

If the answer to item 3 is "statistically significant," the contribution is not yet JFQA-ready.

## Worked compression: a microstructure abstract at the cap

Hypothetical paper: an exchange-level tick-size reform and small-cap liquidity (all numbers illustrative). The first draft ran 127 words and opened with three sentences about electronic markets in general. The JFQA-ready version spends its budget like this:

- Question, ~15 words: does the reform change liquidity for the affected stocks, and through which channel?
- Design, ~25 words: the reform event, roughly 1,200 treated small-caps vs. matched controls, difference-in-differences on intraday quote data.
- Result with numbers, ~40 words: quoted spreads move 11.6 bps (14% of the pre-period mean); depth at the inside changes 22%; effects concentrate where the constraint binds.
- Implication, ~18 words: one sentence on what the elasticity means for tick-size policy.

Every surviving clause carries a finance object, a design cue, or a number. Motivation throat-clearing is the first thing cut, because the 100-word cap punishes it hardest.

## Magnitude phrasing by JFQA subfield

| Subfield | Headline-number form JFQA readers expect | Weak form to delete |
|---|---|---|
| Asset pricing | monthly alpha in bps; premium per one-SD of the characteristic; Sharpe change | "significant at the 1% level" |
| Corporate finance | pp change in leverage/investment/cash, scaled by the sample mean | "positively related to" |
| Microstructure | bps of spread; depth or price-impact change; % of daily volume | "liquidity improves" |
| Institutions/banking | pp change in lending or default probability; capital-ratio effect | "stability increases" |
| Derivatives | implied-vol points; hedging-error reduction; option-return spread | "evidence of mispricing" |

## Referee pushback on framing, with the JFQA repair

| Pushback heard at JFQA | What it signals | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| "The contribution is incremental" | closest-rival delta not quantified | state the number the paper changes and by how much |
| "Magnitudes seem small" | raw coefficient reported without a benchmark | scale by the mean, a one-SD move, or a dollar value |
| "Abstract oversells the design" | causal verbs without causal variation | downgrade verbs to what the design supports |
| "Unclear who cares" | no finance decision-maker named | tie the result to an investor, manager, or regulator choice |

## Output format

```
【Abstract】one paragraph, word count ≤ 100, states result + number
【Question】one sentence
【Contribution】vs. closest rivals, with magnitude
【Implication】for the finance subfield
【Next step】jfqa-tables-figures or jfqa-writing-style
```
