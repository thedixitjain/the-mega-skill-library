# ACL Workflow

Use this as the project-management layer for an ACL paper. Unlike one-deadline
conferences, ACL runs on a **cycle-and-commit** rhythm: pick an ARR cycle, ride
its ~10-week review train, then decide at the commitment window whether to send
the package to the conference or loop back for another cycle.

ACL is a conference with rotating per-edition program committees, not a
journal: there is no standing editor and no APC. Costs are registration-based,
and Anthology publication is free and open access.

## The 2026 rhythm as a worked anchor

ACL 2026 (64th edition, San Diego, July 2-7, 2026) drew from the ARR October
2025 and January 2026 cycles:

| Milestone | Date (verified for ACL 2026) |
|---|---|
| ARR January cycle submission | January 5, 2026 |
| Reviews + meta-reviews to authors | by March 9-10, 2026 |
| Commitment to ACL 2026 | March 14, 2026 |
| Acceptance notification | April 4, 2026 |
| Camera-ready | April 19, 2026 |
| Conference | July 2-7, 2026 |

Later 2026 cycles (March 16, May 25, August 3, October 12 submissions) feed
EMNLP/AACL 2026 and EACL 2027 instead. Every future date is cycle-volatile —
re-read aclrollingreview.org/dates before committing a team to any of them.

## Choosing a cycle

- Work backward from the conference you want: each \*ACL conference announces
  which cycles it accepts commitments from. The *earlier* eligible cycle
  buys a free resubmission shot at the *same* conference if reviews go badly.
- A cycle deadline you hit with a rushed paper is worse than the next cycle
  hit with a finished one — reviews persist and follow resubmissions.
- Mind the response window inside the cycle (a few days, roughly five weeks
  after submission): the team must be available then, not just at submission.

## Backward plan from a cycle deadline

| Weeks out | Milestone for an experiments-heavy NLP paper |
|---|---|
| 8 | Claim fixed; datasets, baselines, and evaluation protocol frozen |
| 6 | Main results in; error-analysis sampling started |
| 4 | Human evaluation fielded; ablations running |
| 3 | Full draft in ACL style; internal red-team read |
| 2 | Responsible NLP checklist drafted against the real paper |
| 1 | Limitations written; anonymity sweep; supplement archive built |
| 0 | Submit early on deadline day (AoE) |

## The resubmission loop

```text
cycle N reviews weak?
  -> revise (new experiments, rescoped claims)
  -> cycle N+1 submission WITH: link to prior submission,
     change summary, point-by-point response to old weaknesses
  -> commit the stronger package to the next eligible conference
```

Budget one loop into any plan that matters: the modal strong ACL paper today
has seen two cycles. Skipping the revision note is a desk reject; a floor
meta-review score forbids quick resubmission without wholesale revision.

## Post-decision branches

- **Main conference**: camera-ready sprint (see `acl-camera-ready`),
  registration, presentation prep, artifact release.
- **Findings**: same camera-ready track; decide early on the presentation
  option the edition offers and whether to present at an affiliated workshop.
- **Reject**: hold a post-mortem against the meta-review within a week while
  context is fresh; choose next cycle + venue deliberately, not reflexively.

## Coordination rules that save cycles

- One owner for the checklist, one for anonymity, one for the supplement —
  the three most common last-day failures are all ownerless tasks.
- Freeze a "submitted" tag in the repo: the author response may only cite
  what that tag contains.
- Calendar the response window and the commitment deadline the day you submit;
  both are short and both are missable.

## Running multiple papers through the machine

- Stagger sibling papers across cycles rather than stacking one deadline:
  the response windows will otherwise collide, and response quality is the
  highest-leverage hour-for-hour work in the pipeline.
- Track each paper as (cycle, state, target venue, fallback venue) — the
  fallback is a real decision because commitment windows do not wait.
- Reuse infrastructure deliberately: one anonymization script, one
  checklist template pre-filled with lab defaults, one supplement layout.
- Reviewer-duty obligations may attach to submissions in current cycles;
  budget senior-author reviewing time into the same calendar (verify the
  current cycle's policy — this has changed over the years).

## Signals to re-plan immediately

- The dates page announces a cycle-structure change (it has happened
  multiple times; 10-week cycles arrived only in May 2025).
- Your target conference posts its eligible-cycle list and your intended
  cycle is not on it.
- Reviews arrive with a fixable core objection and the next cycle's
  deadline is within two weeks — a rushed loop beats a stale package only
  if the fix is genuinely small.
- A competing preprint lands mid-cycle: plan the response-window framing
  and the camera-ready citation now, not at notification.

## Output format

```text
[Stage] planning / cycle-N under review / response window / commit window / accepted / revising
[Target] <conference + eligible ARR cycles, with dates and source>
[Critical path] <three tasks gating the next deadline>
[Loop budget] <cycles remaining before target conference>
[Owner map] <checklist/anonymity/supplement/response owners>
```
