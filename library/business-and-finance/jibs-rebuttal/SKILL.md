# R&R Revision & Response Letter (jibs-rebuttal)

## When to trigger

- You received a JIBS major/minor revision and need a plan plus a response letter
- Reviewers asked for measurement-invariance, CMV, or endogeneity work and you must execute it
- A reviewer invoked a specific "From the Editors" methods editorial
- You need to reconcile conflicting reviewer requests across IB subfields

## Revise the manuscript before you write the letter

A JIBS response letter documents revisions that already exist; do not promise work you have not done. JIBS R&Rs are substantive and multi-round — budget real new analysis (a new estimator, an invariance test, an instrument), not just rhetoric.

## Prioritize by the area editor's letter

The **area editor's letter is the priority map.** Group reviewer comments under the editor's integrated themes; lead your plan with the concerns the editor elevated (typically: phenomenon/contribution, cross-national measurement, CMV, and endogeneity). Where two reviewers conflict, adjudicate transparently and defer to the editor's framing.

## Execute the IB-specific revision work

- **Phenomenon & contribution.** If "incremental" was raised, sharpen the non-incremental IB contribution and the country/culture-as-level payoff (use jibs-contribution-framing).
- **Measurement equivalence.** If equivalence was challenged, add configural/metric/scalar tests (or alignment/partial-invariance) and state which cross-country comparisons remain defensible.
- **Common-method variance.** If CMV was flagged, add a marker-variable or latent-method-factor analysis (not just Harman), or show interaction/cross-level effects survive; cite the JIBS CMV "From the Editors" editorial.
- **Endogeneity / dynamic endogeneity.** If raised for a process design, execute the identification (IV/first-stage strength, dynamic-panel GMM with Hansen/AR(2), DiD/natural experiment) and discuss assumptions; cite the relevant endogeneity editorial.
- **DART.** Update the Data Accessibility Statement if data-availability questions arose.

## Write the point-by-point response

- Restate each comment verbatim, then respond: what you changed, where (section, page, table), and the new result.
- Quote the relevant **methods editorial** when you adopt its recommended remedy — this signals compliance with JIBS standards.
- Be respectful and concrete; where you disagree, give evidence, not assertion, and offer an alternative.
- Provide a brief summary memo of the major changes at the top, and ensure the revised manuscript still fits the **inclusive** word limit.

## Response-craft micro-rewrites (before → after)

The moves a JIBS response letter lives or dies on, in weak and strong form:

- **Invariance demand.** Before: *"We thank Reviewer 2 and now acknowledge measurement equivalence in the limitations."* After: *"Multi-group CFA across all sampled countries shows metric invariance holds; scalar fails for two items, so we re-estimated under partial invariance (new Table 4) and flag which country-mean comparisons remain defensible (p. 18)."* The first defers the work; the second delivers it and names where it lives.
- **Endogeneity demand.** Before: *"Endogeneity is unlikely given our extensive controls."* After: *"Following the dynamic-endogeneity editorial the reviewer cites, we re-estimated with system GMM (collapsed instruments; Hansen and AR(2) diagnostics in Table 5) and discuss the exclusion logic in Section 4.3."* Never argue controls where the canon prescribes identification.
- **"Incremental" verdict.** Before: *"We respectfully believe our contribution is substantial."* After: *"The reviewer is right that the prior draft read as a country replication. The rewritten contribution paragraphs (pp. 3, 29) state what the springboard account now predicts differently, and why a single-country design could not show it."* Concede the reading, then fix the framing — not the reviewer.

## Multi-round discipline

JIBS revisions commonly run more than one round; protect your credibility across rounds:

- Open round 2+ with a **delta memo**: what the area editor asked after round 1, what changed since, and what was deliberately left untouched (with reasons).
- Do **not** reframe the phenomenon, swap the IB lens, or introduce new hypotheses between rounds unless the editor requested it — round-2 drift reads as an unstable paper.
- If a requested analysis **overturns** a round-1 result, disclose it prominently in the memo and revise the contribution claim to match; burying a changed sign in a table note is a trust-killer at a journal that curates its own methods canon.
- When reviewers from different IB subfields pull opposite directions (richer context vs. tighter identification), propose a scoped split to the area editor: main text carries the identification, online appendix the contextual depth — and say so in both response threads.
- When cutting to stay inside the inclusive word budget, tell the editor what moved to the online appendix and confirm nothing load-bearing left the main text.

## Output format

```
【Editor-priority map】ranked themes from the area-editor letter ...
【Per-comment plan】comment → revision (section/page/table) → status ...
【Measurement/CMV/endogeneity work】executed analyses + editorials cited ...
【Conflicts resolved】reviewer A vs. B adjudication ...
【DART/DAS update】 ...
【Word-budget check】revision still within inclusive limit ...
【Response letter】point-by-point draft ...
```

## Anti-patterns

- Promising analyses in the letter that are not actually in the revision.
- Treating reviewers as equal to the area editor's priority map.
- Answering a CMV/endogeneity request with rhetoric instead of new analysis.
- Ignoring a cited methods editorial the reviewer asked you to follow.
- Letting the revised manuscript drift over the inclusive word limit.
