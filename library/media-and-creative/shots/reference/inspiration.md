# Screenshot Inspiration Reference

This page provides complete visual direction examples from successful Shots campaigns. Use these as templates when planning screenshot sets — complete with palette specs, compositional patterns, headline formulas, and proven style families.

## How to Use This Reference

**Important:** These examples are reference patterns to adapt, not templates to copy verbatim.

- **Adapt colors:** Change palette hex codes to match your app's brand
- **Rewrite headlines:** Adjust to reflect your app's specific value proposition
- **Show real UI:** Device screens must show YOUR app's actual interface (never copy example UI)
- **Customize patterns:** Use compositional patterns as starting points, not rigid rules
- **Make it yours:** Draw inspiration from style families, but customize for your app's personality

The goal is to understand proven patterns and apply them creatively to your specific app and audience.

For public App Store inspiration, use `gallery.ensure_app` or
`gallery.get_app`, then pass the chosen `galleryInspirationScreenshotId` to
`generate_screenshot`. Treat gallery screenshots as approved ad-mechanism and
composition references: layer stack, text hierarchy, object treatment, crop,
color, typography, pacing, and tone. Product references still control the real
app UI and product facts. Never copy another app's UI, claims, brand, people,
or product state.

Preserve the gallery screenshot's primary object category and exact text-slot behavior by default. Do not turn a top decision object into a search icon, phone, logo, or abstract metaphor unless the user explicitly asks for that change.

The strongest results come from a near-edit contract. Pick one screenshot and
say what stays structurally intact, then say exactly what changes into the
current app's truth. For example:

```text
Change:
Turn Image 1's social-photo ad into this app's camera-roll discovery ad.

Preserve from Image 1:
- Same tight crop and crowded top-to-bottom rhythm.
- Same top object, headline slots, bottom sticker, and printed-card collage.
- Same cutout shadows, flash lighting, and foreground/background depth.

Replace only the content:
- Replace source app copy with "STOP HUNTING", "FOR THE RIGHT PHOTO", and
  "find moments that matter".
- Replace source people/UI/claims with truthful app moments, labels, metadata,
  or small product-proof chips.

Composition:
No central phone frame if Image 1 has no central phone. Product screenshots are
truth references, not layout references.
Do not rewrite the locked copy into a nearby but different claim; exact text beats clever new wording.
```

When writing the prompt for a gallery-inspired generation, include a compact
`Reference usage` section:

- Preserve: name 3-5 concrete mechanics from the gallery image, such as crop,
  layer order, text-slot hierarchy, floating card overlap, object material,
  lighting direction, or foreground/background rhythm.
- Change: say what becomes the current app's truth, such as headline copy,
  app UI, screenshots, product claims, people, device screen content, and brand
  colors.
- Ground: name the uploaded product references that control real UI labels,
  controls, screen density, brand colors, and shipped-feeling details.
- Conflict rule: if the gallery composition and product screenshot layout
  disagree, preserve the gallery composition and show product truth only as
  chips, labels, cards, metadata, or a deliberately small UI fragment.

Avoid prompts that only say "use this style." The image model responds better
when the prompt states exactly what should be preserved and exactly what should
change.

If the user asks for inspiration behavior Shots does not support, or repeatedly
tries to work around gallery limits, call `feedback.report` with
`category: "unsupported_workflow"` or `category: "feature_request"` and briefly
tell the user you notified the Shots team.

## Prompt Format

Write screenshot prompts as complete plain text. The server automatically
appends dimensions, constraints, and reference metadata. Use only the sections
the concept needs, and do not force device/headline fields when the reference is
visual-first or text-free.

## Icon Moodboard Approach

### Contact Sheet Format

Icon moodboards generate as a **2048x2048 contact sheet** with ~20 numbered concepts arranged in a grid. Each concept is a small icon preview (~180–220px square) with a number label.

**Purpose:** Brainstorming step before finals. User picks favorites by number, then you generate individual 1024x1024 finals.

**Cost:** 5 generation credits

### Variety Requirements

Successful moodboards include:

1. **Symbol Variety**
   - Abstract geometric marks
   - Literal objects that represent the app
   - Mascot or character concepts when appropriate
   - Hybrid object + abstract background concepts

2. **Background Variety**
   - Solid full-bleed color
   - Radial, linear, or angular gradients
   - Subtle texture or material fields
   - High-contrast light/dark variants

3. **Style Variety**
   - Flat/minimal
   - Dimensional 3D with shadows and highlights
   - Glass or translucent objects
   - Clay/soft mascot forms
   - Photorealistic object icons

4. **Color Range**
   - Brand colors if specified
   - Adjacent hues
   - Bold contrasts
   - Monochrome variations

### Example Prompt Structure

Use `generate_icon_moodboard` tool fields, but keep `creative_direction` as a
plain-text brief rather than JSON-shaped image instructions:

```text
Generate an icon moodboard for [App Name], a [category] app that [core function].

Symbol exploration: include [primary symbol], [secondary symbol], and abstract
representations of [core concept]. Avoid text or letter marks unless the user
explicitly wants brand-mark exploration.

Background directions: try full-bleed [brand color], gradients in [color range],
and subtle textured options.

Style mix: include flat minimalist options, dimensional/3D treatments, glass or
translucent forms, and one photorealistic object direction when it fits.

Audience: [target user] who values [key attributes].
```

### After Moodboard Review

Once the user selects favorites (e.g., "I like #7, #12, and #19"), generate
individual finals with `generate_icon` using specific direction:

```text
style: dimensional gradient with soft shadows, inspired by moodboard #7
symbol: stylized wave arc
background: radial gradient from teal to deep blue
creative_direction: one upload-ready 1024x1024 full-bleed square app icon
source artwork; no text, no rounded mask, no preview tile
```

## Compositional Patterns

### Device Placement

**Centered-Right:**
- Headline and subtitle stack in left third
- Device in right two-thirds with slight tilt
- Leaves room for text hierarchy
- Example: Pulse Panel 1

**Centered-Left:**
- Headline and subtitle in right third
- Device in left two-thirds
- Breakout elements can fan right
- Example: Closet Panel 1

**Center with Lean:**
- Device centered with 3–5° tilt
- Headline spans top
- Breakout elements cascade to one side
- Example: Closet Panel 3

**Full-Bleed Split:**
- Background photo bleeds left 45%
- Device center-right overlaps photo
- Headline spans full width at top
- Creates editorial magazine effect
- Example: Closet Panel 2

### Breakout Element Strategies

**Fan/Burst:**
- 4–5 elements radiating from device edge
- Varying sizes and rotation
- Progressive drop shadows
- Creates "many outputs" narrative
- Example: Pull hero (2 selfies → 50+ photos)

**Cascading Stack:**
- 3 cards in staggered arc
- Each rotated slightly (–8°, 0°, +6°)
- Layered with progressive shadows
- Suggests depth and abundance
- Example: Closet Panel 3 (Discover feed)

**Bleed Continuity:**
- UI element extends from device into background
- Fades to transparent at edges
- Creates immersion
- Example: Pulse Panel 1 (ECG waveform)

**Floating Feature Card:**
- Large card breaks dramatically above/beside device
- Shows mini UI preview or detail
- Label badge with accent color
- Prominent warm drop shadow
- Example: Closet Panel 2 (AI suggestion card)

### Background Depth Techniques

**Radial Glow Bloom:**
- Soft gradient glow behind device
- Accent color at center fading to transparent
- Creates focal depth and mood
- Match glow color to panel theme (red = energy, blue = precision, green = readiness)

**Ghost UI Elements:**
- Large semi-transparent version of key UI element
- Sits behind device at 8–15% opacity
- Reinforces visual theme without competing
- Example: Pulse Panel 2 (ghost zone ring), Pulse Panel 3 (ghost recovery circle)

**Texture Overlays:**
- Subtle fabric/linen texture at 6–8% opacity
- Adds tactile warmth without noise
- Works for warm/luxury styles
- Example: Closet backgrounds

**Editorial Photography:**
- Full-bleed lifestyle photo blurred at 20%
- Occupies 40–50% of panel
- Thin hairline rule separates from UI zone
- Adds aspiration and context
- Example: Closet Panel 2

### Typography Hierarchy

**Large Bold Headlines:**
- 36–60pt depending on style family
- Pure white or near-black for maximum contrast
- 2 lines max, tight leading
- Left-aligned or centered per layout
- Must be readable at 60px thumbnail width

**Supporting Subtitles:**
- 16–26pt, regular or medium weight
- Muted color (warm brown for warm palettes, blue-white for dark palettes)
- 1–2 lines max
- Sits 12–16pt below headline
- Provides clarifying detail without competing

**Text Placement:**
- Keep all text 80px+ from edges
- Never overlay text on busy backgrounds without scrim
- Prioritize readability over decoration

## Prompting Tips

Write prompts as complete plain text. Use markdown-style sections when they help
the brief scan, but do not force every screenshot into the same structure.

1. **Use complete palette specs with hex codes** — don't say "warm colors," say `#C9A97A` and `#F5EFE6`
2. **Specify exact device model and tilt** — "iPhone 16 Pro, natural titanium frame, 3° left tilt"
3. **Name the style family** — "Editorial warm-luxury" or "Dark cinematic gradient"
4. **Include motif list** — recurring visual elements that create brand signature
5. **Quote text verbatim** — headlines and subtitles should render >95% accurate
6. **Describe device screen UI in detail** — never say "app UI" or "placeholder screen"
7. **Specify breakout elements precisely** — how many, where placed, rotation degrees, shadow type
8. **Include background composition** — gradient directions, texture overlays, glow positions, opacity percentages
