# Game Vector Math Primitives

Use this skill when game code depends on vector operations whose geometric
meaning matters. Prefer clear primitives and named intent over opaque formula
paste.

Primary source: Geometry for Programmers by Oleksandr Kaleniuk
(https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers), transformed and
paraphrased, especially chapters 2 and 9.

## Core Workflow

1. Identify the geometric question: angle, projection, side, area, normal,
   volume, distance, facing, or interpolation.
2. Choose the primitive that answers that question directly.
3. Check the input assumptions: dimensionality, coordinate space, units,
   handedness, normalization, and zero-length vectors.
4. Preserve sign when orientation or sidedness matters. Discard sign only when
   the caller truly needs magnitude.
5. Name intermediate values by meaning: `normal`, `signed_area2`,
   `light_factor`, `plane_distance`, `facing`, `projection_t`.
6. Add tests that exercise orientation, reversed winding, orthogonal vectors,
   parallel vectors, and zero-length inputs.

## Primitive Guide

### Dot Product

Use dot products for:

- Projection onto a direction.
- Angle/facing tests.
- Lambert-style lighting coefficients.
- Distance along a ray or segment.
- Checking orthogonality: dot equals zero under the numeric policy.

If both vectors are normalized, the dot product is the cosine of the angle
between them. Clamp before inverse cosine if a display angle is needed.

### Cross Product And 2D Cross Scalar

Use cross products for:

- Surface normals from two triangle edges.
- Signed 2D orientation tests.
- Twice the signed area of a 2D triangle.
- Detecting parallel vectors through near-zero magnitude.
- Building tangent frames with a known handedness.

For 2D, use the scalar `a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x` instead of constructing fake 3D
vectors unless the codebase already uses a 3D type.

### Triple Product

Use the scalar triple product for:

- Signed volume.
- Point side relative to an oriented plane.
- Point-to-plane distance when divided by the plane normal length.
- Tetrahedron orientation and containment-style predicates.

Keep the sign when side matters. Take absolute value only for unsigned volume or
distance.

## Guardrails

- Never normalize before checking vector length.
- Distinguish a direction vector from a point vector in naming and APIs.
- Keep normals in the same space as the vectors they are compared with.
- Recompute or transform normals correctly after nonuniform scale.
- Decide whether clockwise or counterclockwise winding is canonical.
- Use squared length when comparing distances and no square root is needed.
- Avoid inverse trigonometric functions in hot paths unless a real angle is
  required. Dot thresholds are usually cheaper.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating every vector as normalized because examples used unit vectors.
- Losing useful sign information by taking absolute values too early.
- Mixing coordinate spaces in one dot or cross operation.
- Using angle calculations where a dot-product threshold would be simpler.
- Flipping triangle winding without updating normals, culling, or orientation
  predicates.
