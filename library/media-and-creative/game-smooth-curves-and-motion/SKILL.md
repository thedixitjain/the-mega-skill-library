# Game Smooth Curves And Motion

Use this skill to design path and curve systems where continuity, control, and
game feel matter more than exact mathematical purity.

Primary source: Geometry for Programmers by Oleksandr Kaleniuk
(https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers), transformed and
paraphrased, especially chapters 5-7. Additional source: A Primer on Bezier
Curves by Pomax (https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/).

## Core Workflow

1. Identify what must be smooth: position, tangent direction, speed, curvature,
   camera orientation, banking, or animation value.
2. Choose the curve family that gives the needed controls with the least state:
   linear segments, cubic Hermite, Catmull-Rom, Bezier, B-spline, NURBS, or a
   custom polynomial piece.
3. Define continuity targets:
   - C0: pieces meet at positions.
   - C1: tangents match for visually smooth direction.
   - C2: curvature changes smoothly.
4. Decide parameterization: uniform `t`, chord length, centripetal, explicit
   timing, or arc-length lookup.
5. Separate authoring controls from runtime samples. Designers may edit points
   and handles; the game may use baked lookup tables.
6. Test extreme control points, sharp turns, closed loops, repeated points, and
   speed variation.

## Curve Selection

- Use linear segments for grid motion, debug paths, and intentionally sharp
  routes.
- Use cubic Hermite when you know endpoint positions and tangent vectors.
- Use Bezier curves when control handles are the natural authoring interface.
- Use Catmull-Rom-style splines when paths should pass through waypoints with
  minimal handle authoring.
- Use B-splines or NURBS when many control points, high continuity, or exact
  conic sections matter.
- Avoid one high-degree global polynomial through many points. Split into
  pieces to avoid oscillation and poor local control.

## Motion Rules

- Smooth position does not imply smooth speed. Check derivative length along
  the path.
- Constant `t` increments rarely produce constant world-space speed.
- For nearly constant speed, precompute an arc-length table and map distance
  traveled back to curve parameter.
- Tangent length affects both speed and curve shape in Hermite-like systems.
- Normalize tangent direction only when speed should be controlled separately.
- Keep gameplay collision separate from visual smoothing when curves are only
  a presentation layer.

## Implementation Checklist

- Curve type and continuity target are documented.
- Parameter range and units are explicit.
- Closed paths handle first/last continuity deliberately.
- Runtime evaluation is bounded and allocation-free in hot paths.
- Baked samples include position, tangent, optional normal/binormal, and
  cumulative distance when needed.
- Debug view shows control points, handles, samples, tangents, and speed heat.

## Common Mistakes

- Using interpolation that passes through every point when approximation would
  be smoother and more stable.
- Assuming Bezier handles are points on the curve.
- Letting repeated or near-repeated points create undefined tangents.
- Moving a camera at constant parameter speed and calling the result constant
  motion.
- Adding more control points to fix a curve that needs a different
  parameterization or continuity target.
