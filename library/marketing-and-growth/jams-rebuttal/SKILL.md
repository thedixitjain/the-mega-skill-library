# R&R Revision & Response (jams-rebuttal)

## When to trigger

- You received a JAMS major/minor revision and need a plan and a response letter
- A reviewer challenged the **theoretical contribution**, **managerial relevance**, construct validity, or identification
- You must revise *before* writing the response (do not draft the letter on an unrevised paper)
- A subsequent round arrived and you need to show movement since the last revision

## Sequence: revise first, then respond

JAMS R&Rs are **developmental and often multi-round**. Revise the manuscript first; the response letter documents changes that already exist. Lead the work with the **editor's decisive concerns**, which at JAMS almost always include the two gates: a genuine **theoretical contribution** and a clear **managerial contribution**. A revision that polishes peripheral points but leaves a gate unaddressed will not advance — and area editors track whether each round actually moves on the issues they flagged.

## Build the response letter

- **Open** with a brief summary of the most important changes and how the paper is now stronger on both the theory and managerial bars.
- **Point-by-point:** restate each comment, then state the change, with **section/page or quoted-text pointers** to the revised manuscript (cite sections/pages or quote the revised text; do not rely on line numbers that shift).
- **Quote new text inline** so the editor and reviewers see the change without hunting.
- **Stay anonymized:** no author-revealing language anywhere in the letter or revised files; keep preregistration/repository links anonymized.
- **Be candid on disagreements:** where you decline a suggestion, explain respectfully with evidence; never silently ignore a comment.

## Address JAMS-specific concerns head-on

- **"Theoretical contribution is incremental / new context"** → foreground the new mechanism, contingency, reconciliation, or validated construct; revise the contribution sentences (see `jams-contribution-framing`) and the conceptual model (see `jams-theory-development`).
- **"So what for managers?"** → add or sharpen the managerial-implications subsection: name the decision, quantify the stake in managerial units, and state the guardrails (boundary conditions).
- **"Common method variance" (survey)** → add a marker-variable / CFA-marker test and design-based defenses; report discriminant validity via HTMT (see `jams-methods`).
- **"Endogeneity / identification is weak" (secondary data)** → add the design-appropriate fix (instrument, Gaussian-copula control, modern DiD, robustness/placebo) per `jams-data-analysis`.
- **"Effect sizes / magnitude missing"** → ensure standardized effects, CIs, and managerial magnitudes appear throughout.

## Prepare transparency deliverables

If the revision is heading toward conditional acceptance, prepare the **data and code availability statement** and any repository deposit (e.g., OSF / Mendeley Data) per Springer policy, so acceptance is not a scramble. Keep deposited materials and links anonymized while review continues.

## Triage the comments before you start revising

Not every comment carries equal weight. Sort them into a working table so effort follows priority:

| Tier | What it is | How to handle |
|---|---|---|
| Decisive | Editor-flagged "must address"; touches the theory or managerial gate | Do first; lead the response and the revision with these |
| Substantive | Validity/identification (CMV, endogeneity), positioning, missing analysis | Address fully with new analysis or reframing |
| Clarifying | Exposition, construct naming, exhibit readability | Fix and note briefly |
| Decline | A request that would harm the paper or exceeds the design | Decline respectfully, with evidence and reasoning |

The fastest way to lose a JAMS R&R is to spend the revision on tier-3 polish while a decisive tier-1 concern is met with a paragraph instead of new work.

## Show movement across rounds

JAMS R&Rs are often multi-round, and area editors track whether each revision actually moves on the concerns they flagged. In a second-round letter, briefly remind the editor what changed since the prior round and how the remaining concerns were addressed, so progress is visible rather than buried. Avoid re-litigating points already settled in an earlier round; reopening a resolved issue signals that the paper is going backward. The trajectory the editor wants to see is a paper that is demonstrably stronger on the theory and managerial gates with each pass.

## Handle conflicting reviewers

When two reviewers pull in opposite directions, do not silently side with one. State the tension to the editor in the response letter, explain the choice you made and why (often deferring to the editor's stated priorities), and where feasible offer a compromise (e.g., a robustness analysis in the appendix that satisfies the second reviewer). Surfacing the conflict is read as candor; ignoring one reviewer to please the other is read as evasion and usually resurfaces in the next round.

## Checklist

- [ ] Manuscript revised before the letter was drafted
- [ ] Editor's decisive concerns addressed first
- [ ] Theoretical-contribution and managerial-relevance challenges answered explicitly
- [ ] Validity/identification fixes (CMV, endogeneity) completed where requested
- [ ] Effect sizes and managerial magnitudes verified throughout after revision
- [ ] Point-by-point letter with section/page pointers and quoted new text
- [ ] Anonymization preserved in letter and files (incl. prereg/repository links)
- [ ] Data/code availability statement prepared if nearing acceptance

## Anti-patterns

- **Letter before revision** — promising changes not yet made
- **Cosmetic edits** to a gatekeeping (theory/managerial) concern
- **Defensive non-answers** that dodge a reviewer's point
- **Reintroducing identity** in the response or revised files
- **Over-claiming** new results beyond what the added analysis supports
- Answering the theory comments while leaving the managerial-relevance comments thin

## Output format

```text
【Revision done first】yes/no
【Editor decisive concerns addressed】[...]
【Theory + managerial answers】[...]
【Validity/identification additions】CMV / endogeneity / robustness: [...]
【Effect-size + magnitude check】verified post-revision? yes/fix
【Letter】point-by-point with pointers + quoted text drafted?
【Anonymization】preserved (incl. links)?
【Transparency】data/code statement + deposit if nearing acceptance: [...]
【Next step】resubmit via Editorial Manager → jams-review-process for the next round
```
