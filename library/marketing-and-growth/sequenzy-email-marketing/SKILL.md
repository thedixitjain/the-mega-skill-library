# Sequenzy Email Marketing

## Overview

Use this skill when the task is to operate Sequenzy, not to change Sequenzy's source code. Prefer the `sequenzy` CLI for supported workflows, treat `packages/mcp/src/tools/index.ts` as the MCP source of truth when the task goes through MCP tools, and explicitly call out when a requested workflow is not wired in the current implementation.

## Ground Rules

1. Treat `packages/cli/src/index.tsx` as the source of truth for which commands are actually wired.
2. Treat `packages/cli/src/commands/` and `packages/cli/src/api.ts` as the source of truth for CLI behavior, payload shape, and API routes.
3. Treat `packages/mcp/src/tools/index.ts` as the source of truth for MCP tool names, arguments, and preflight validation.
4. Do not promise support for commands or tools that only appear in docs or `--help` text without an attached implementation.
5. Prefer `sequenzy login` for interactive auth and `SEQUENZY_API_KEY` for automation.
6. Prefer inspection before mutation whenever the workflow allows it.

## Supported Workflows

Read [references/use-cases.md](references/use-cases.md) before executing anything non-trivial. The currently implemented CLI flows are:

- login and logout
- local auth/session check with `whoami`
- account inspection with `account`
- company inspection or creation with `companies list|get|create`
- stats overview or stats by campaign/sequence ID
- subscribers `list`, `add`, `get`, and `remove`, with `list` fetching every page by default and supporting tag, segment, and list filters
- lists `list`, `create`, `add-subscribers`, and `import` alias for bulk list population from emails, JSON, CSV, or newline files
- tags `list`
- segments `list`, `create`, and `count`, including `--match any`, nested filter roots, custom event filters, and saved-segment composition filters
- templates `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`, with `list` supporting label filters and `create`/`update` accepting labels, raw HTML, or Sequenzy block JSON
- campaigns `list`, `get`, `create`, `update` including label and reply-to updates, `schedule`, and `test`, with `list` supporting label filters, `create` accepting labels plus raw HTML, Sequenzy block JSON, or prompt-generated content, `update` accepting labels plus raw HTML or Sequenzy block JSON, and `schedule` returning a review preview link
- MCP template and campaign tools support labels on list/create/update; MCP `update_campaign` also supports `replyTo` and `replyProfileId`, and MCP `schedule_campaign` schedules draft or already scheduled campaigns
- MCP `search_subscribers` supports list filters through `list`, `listId`, or `listName`; MCP `add_subscribers_to_list` accepts up to 500 emails per call
- sequences `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `enable`, `disable`, `delete`, and `cancel-enrollments`, including explicit discount action steps, cancellation by subscriber ID or event-property field values, and `update` branch insertion with tag, list, segment, event, clicked-link, and field conditions; event and clicked-link branch checks can use `activityScope` (`this_sequence`, `previous_email`, `ever`)
- AI generation with `generate email`, `generate sequence`, and `generate subjects`
- dashboard URL generation with CLI `urls`, MCP `get_app_urls`, and `appUrls`/`url` fields on campaign, sequence, template, and company results
- websites `list`, `add`, `check`, and `guide`
- API key creation with `api-keys create`
- send one transactional email by template or raw HTML

## Unsupported Or Placeholder Workflows

Treat missing subcommands as unsupported even when the noun exists. For example: campaign immediate send, pause/cancel flows, list deletion, and tag mutation are not available through the current CLI handlers. Bulk list population is supported through `sequenzy lists add-subscribers` and its `sequenzy lists import` alias, not through `subscribers add`.

## Execution Pattern

1. Check auth first with `sequenzy whoami` or by verifying `SEQUENZY_API_KEY` is set.
2. Pick the narrowest command that matches the use case.
3. Validate IDs, recipient email, subject, template, or content input before issuing a mutation.
4. Surface CLI limitations directly instead of inventing a workaround.
5. If the workflow is unsupported in the CLI, say whether the next-best path is the Sequenzy dashboard or direct API use.
6. When you create, inspect, or schedule a campaign, sequence, template, or company and the user may want to review/edit it, surface the dashboard URL from `url`, `previewUrl`, or `appUrls` in the tool/CLI output. If needed, generate it with `sequenzy urls` or MCP `get_app_urls`.
7. Call out implementation caveats that matter operationally, such as `whoami` using cached local auth state, sequence creation supporting both `--goal` and explicit step modes, explicit discount steps requiring Stripe before activation, generated sequences being capped at 10 emails, `campaigns test` being a stubbed success path in the current backend, and conditional email content requiring block JSON rather than raw HTML.

## Dashboard URLs

Use `SEQUENZY_APP_URL` as the dashboard base when it is set; otherwise default to `https://sequenzy.com`.

Prefer actual URLs returned by the CLI/MCP result:

- sequence editor: `/dashboard/company/{companyId}/sequences/{sequenceId}`
- campaign editor: `/dashboard/company/{companyId}/campaign/{campaignId}`
- campaign preview/review: `/dashboard/company/{companyId}/campaign/{campaignId}?step=review`
- template/email editor: `/dashboard/company/{companyId}/emails/{emailId}`
- settings: `/dashboard/company/{companyId}/settings`
- settings tab: `/dashboard/company/{companyId}/settings?tab={tab}`

Useful settings tabs include `domain`, `tracking`, `localization`, `integrations`, `events`, `tags`, `goals`, `sync-rules`, `api-keys`, `widgets`, and `team`.
