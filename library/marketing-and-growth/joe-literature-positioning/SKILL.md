# Literature Positioning (joe-literature-positioning)

## When to trigger

- A referee could ask "how is this different from [known estimator/test]?" and you lack a crisp answer
- The related-work section lists papers but never states the precise gap
- You cannot name the single closest prior method and the exact dimension on which you improve
- Reviewers might think the result is a special case of something already published

## Why positioning is decisive at JoE

The *Journal of Econometrics* judges a paper first on its **methodological novelty and rigor**. Editors screen submissions before sending suitable papers to a **minimum of two independent referees** (single-anonymized review), and these referees are typically specialists who know the nearest competing methods cold. A manuscript that does not locate itself precisely against the frontier reads as either redundant or unaware — both are desk- or referee-level rejections. Positioning is not a literature dump; it is an argument that a specific gap exists and that you close it.

## Positioning moves specific to econometric methodology

State the contribution along the axes referees actually use:

1. **Assumptions** — do you achieve the result under *weaker* or more *primitive* conditions (e.g., dropping homoskedasticity, allowing dependence, weak identification, fewer moment conditions)?
2. **Generality** — does the method cover a broader class of models, DGPs, or data structures (panel, time series, network, high-dimensional)?
3. **Efficiency / rate** — better asymptotic variance, faster convergence rate, semiparametric efficiency, or oracle property?
4. **Inference validity** — correct size where existing tests over/under-reject; uniform validity; robustness to nuisance parameters or tuning choices.
5. **Computation** — feasible where prior methods are intractable, with the *same* statistical guarantees.

Then tie each claimed gap to a citation and, ideally, to a Monte Carlo comparison and a theorem.

## Building the positioning

- Identify the **single nearest method** and write one sentence: "Unlike X (Author, year), which assumes/achieves ___, we ___."
- Map the **lineage**: the classical result, the modern refinements, and where you sit.
- Use **Elsevier reference style** (numbered or author-year, CSL-compatible); cite datasets with the `[dataset]` tag where relevant.
- Pre-empt the "special case" objection: show explicitly that prior results are nested or that your conditions are not implied by theirs.

## Anti-patterns

- A related-work paragraph that summarizes papers but never states *your* delta
- Claiming "novel" against a strawman while ignoring the closest competitor
- Comparing only on intuition with no Monte Carlo or analytic comparison
- Over-broad claims ("first to...") that a referee can falsify with one citation


## Positioning pass for Journal of Econometrics

Use this as a second-pass capability check. First lock the estimand or theorem, assumptions, asymptotic/simulation evidence, and applied relevance; then test whether the manuscript addresses econometrics reviewers who expect methodological novelty, assumptions, simulation or empirical illustration, and reproducibility.

- **Primary move:** Map incumbent conversation, unresolved tension, this manuscript's delta, and the sibling-venue omission a referee might notice.
- **Decision ledger:** return `claim / evidence / blocker / next edit` rows so the next pass can patch the manuscript directly.
- **Neighbor test:** compare against Econometric Theory for proof-first work, JBES for applied statistical methods, Quantitative Economics for economics-theory methods; if the neighboring outlet has the stronger audience claim, recommend re-routing before polishing.
- **Verification floor:** before submission-ready advice, re-open `resources/official-source-map.md` for volatile rules and name the one unresolved fact that could change the recommendation.

## Output format

```
【Nearest method】Author (year): assumes/achieves ___
【Our delta】weaker assumptions / generality / efficiency / inference / computation
【One-sentence positioning】"Unlike X, we ___."
【Lineage】classical → refinement → this paper
【Evidence of the gap】theorem ref + Monte Carlo comparison
【Next step】joe-identification-strategy
```
