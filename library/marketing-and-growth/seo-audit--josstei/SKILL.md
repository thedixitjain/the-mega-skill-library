# Maestro SEO Audit

Call `get_skill_content` with resources: ["architecture"].

## Protocol

Before delegating, call `get_skill_content` with resources: ["delegation"] and follow the returned methodology.

## Workflow

1. Define the SEO audit scope (page or site)
2. Identify web-facing output files (HTML, templates, routes)
3. Audit meta tags, schema markup, crawlability, canonicalization, internal linking, and Core Web Vitals
4. Present findings with severity, SEO impact, location, and remediation guidance
5. Note any checks that require live-site verification if the current environment cannot provide it

## Constraints

- Present findings before proposing remediation
- Do not modify code without explicit user approval
