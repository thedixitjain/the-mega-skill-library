# IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (ieee-transactions-on-pattern-analysis-and-machine-intelligence)

## Journal positioning

IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship archival journal for computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning methods. It is a journal — not a conference proceeding — and its culture reflects that distinction: papers are expected to be definitive, complete, and archival in depth rather than fast-moving and preliminary. The readership is the technical computer vision and ML methods community, and the bar is methodological rigor, thorough evaluation, and reproducibility rather than the hype-and-benchmark culture of conference proceedings. Accepted papers often represent a mature, extended contribution relative to prior conference work.

This skill is a **fit / venue-selection / re-framing** tool. It does not replace the journal's current official submission guidelines. Before submitting, re-check the live author instructions on the IEEE Computer Society / TPAMI site and the submission system.

## When to trigger

- The author names TPAMI as the target venue.
- A computer vision, pattern recognition, or ML methods paper is ready for archival publication and the author is assessing depth, reproducibility, and format fit.
- A conference paper is being extended to journal length and the author wants to ensure the extension meets TPAMI's archival standard.
- The author needs to understand TPAMI's specific rejection profile compared with conference venues.

## Scope & topic fit

- Computer vision: image/video understanding, 3-D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection, recognition, and generation — with methodological advance.
- Pattern recognition: statistical and structural pattern analysis methods with demonstrated generality across problems or domains.
- Machine learning methods with direct relevance to vision or broader ML foundations: representation learning, deep architectures, optimization, generalization theory.
- Medical image analysis, remote sensing, document analysis, and scene understanding where methodological rigor is primary.
- Evaluation methodology, datasets, and benchmarking — where the contribution is the benchmark design and analysis, not just performance on it.
- Multimodal learning, video understanding, and 3-D vision methods.

## Method & evidence bar

- Archival completeness is the core standard: the paper must be self-contained, with thorough derivations, proofs of key properties (where applicable), and complete experimental protocols.
- Evaluation must be exhaustive by journal standards: multiple standard benchmarks, ablation studies that isolate each component's contribution, comparison against a broad set of contemporaneous baselines.
- Reproducibility is not optional: code release is strongly expected; all hyperparameters, training details, and experimental conditions must be reported to enable reproduction.
- Conference-extension papers must offer at least substantial additional technical content (new experiments, extended theory, new application domains, or deeper analysis) beyond the conference version; re-check current TPAMI extension policy.
- Statistical rigor in comparison: performance differences should be assessed with appropriate significance tests where dataset size permits; cherry-picked examples should be accompanied by quantitative results.
- Theoretical contributions (if any) must be rigorously proved; claims of theoretical properties require formal statements and proofs.

## Structure & house style

- IEEE double-column format; re-check current TPAMI formatting requirements and length limits.
- Abstract is unstructured; index terms (IEEE taxonomy) are required.
- Introduction must clearly state the problem, existing limitations, the paper's technical contribution, and the extent of the evaluation.
- A prior-work section that is thorough, fair, and analytically positioned — not a laundry list — is expected given the archival nature.
- Experimental section should be organized by benchmark or research question, not by ablation type; make it easy to find the comparison a reviewer will want.
- Supplementary material can carry additional experiments; main text should contain all central results.
- For conference extensions, a section explicitly describing what is new relative to the conference version is required.

## Official-submission checklist

- Before giving submission-ready advice, read `../../resources/source-basis.md` and `../../resources/official-source-map.md`; start from the official source anchors for this journal family, then cite the current journal-specific page you checked.
- Search the live IEEE site for "TPAMI information for authors" and follow the current IEEE Computer Society version.
- Re-check page/length limits and double-column formatting requirements.
- Confirm IEEE Open Access options and check the current policy on conference-to-journal extensions.
- Prepare index terms using IEEE taxonomy.
- Include code availability statement; check IEEE data-sharing and software-licensing requirements.
- Complete IEEE conflict-of-interest and author-contribution disclosures.
- Check AI-use disclosure requirements.
- If the live official instructions conflict with this skill, the official instructions win.

## Pre-submission self-check

- [ ] One sentence stating the methodological contribution and what CV/ML problem it definitively solves or advances.
- [ ] The paper is archivally complete: proofs, derivations, and full experimental details are present or in supplementary material.
- [ ] All baselines are contemporaneous and fairly compared; ablations isolate each design decision.
- [ ] Code is released or committed to release; all training and evaluation details are reproducible.
- [ ] If a conference extension, the new content is substantial and explicitly documented.
- [ ] IEEE formatting, index terms, and length comply with current instructions.

## Common desk-reject triggers

- Conference paper submitted without substantial new content; re-use of conference text without adequate extension.
- Evaluation on a narrow set of benchmarks without ablations or without comparison to the full relevant prior art.
- No code release and no compelling justification; results that cannot be reproduced from the paper alone.
- Theoretical claims made without proof or with only intuitive justification.
- Paper reads as a proceedings contribution (fast-paced, preliminary) rather than an archival journal article (complete, definitive).

## Re-routing decision

Papers with broad ML significance beyond CV/pattern-recognition methods → `journal-of-machine-learning-research` or `nature-machine-intelligence`. Work with a strong robotics integration and demonstrated system capability → `science-robotics`. Fast-moving results where time-to-publication is critical → conference venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS). Pure ML theory without CV relevance → `journal-of-machine-learning-research`.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] High / Medium / Low (one-line reason)
[Target] IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
[Topic tags] <2–3 closest topics>
[Method/evidence] <does the archival completeness and evaluation rigor clear the TPAMI bar?>
[Top risk] <the single most likely reason for rejection>
[Official items to re-check] <length / format / IEEE index terms / code availability / extension policy / disclosures>
[Re-route suggestion] <if not a fit, a better-matched venue>
```
