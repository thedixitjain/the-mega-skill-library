# Review Process (pom-review-process)

## When to trigger

- You want to understand how POM evaluates papers before or after submitting
- You received a decision letter and need to read it correctly
- You are tempted to resubmit a rejected paper and need to know the rule

## How POM review works

POM routes each submission to a **Department**, where a **Department Editor** owns the paper end to end — this department/college structure is a defining POMS norm, distinct from a single central editor. The Department Editor screens for fit and contribution, then manages **double-blind** peer review. Founder & Editor-in-Chief **Kalyan Singhal** (University of Baltimore) leads the journal, with **Subodha Kumar** as Co-Editor-in-Chief (verified via POMS / SAGE, 2026-06-22; re-check the masthead before relying on it).

## What reviewers weigh

POM applies a **twin standard**: scholarly rigor **and** significant interest to practicing operations managers. Expect two lenses:

- **Method specialists** scrutinize assumptions, proofs, identification, validation, and robustness within your track (analytical/empirical/behavioral/data-science).
- **Broad OM reviewers** ask whether the insight generalizes and **changes an operations decision**. A technically clean paper with thin managerial relevance can still be rejected.

The practice-relevance gate is real and is reinforced by POMS's award culture (e.g., Wickham Skinner, Martin K. Starr, the J. George Shanthikumar Best Data Science and eOperations Paper, and the Cheryl Gaimon Best Innovation Paper), which honor papers tied to specific departments at the POMS Annual Conference.

## The strict no-resubmission rule

POM is **stricter than most peers**: a paper **rejected** in one department may **not** be resubmitted to the same *or a different* department of the journal **unless the decision letter explicitly invited resubmission**. Read the letter carefully — only an explicit invitation reopens the door. An R&R ("revise and resubmit") *is* such an invitation; a reject is not, and reframing a reject as a new submission risks a desk reject and reputational cost.

## Reading the decision letter

- **R&R / major or minor revision:** route to `pom-rebuttal`; keep the same Department Editor across rounds. Revised manuscripts still respect the **32-page** main-document cap.
- **Reject:** unless resubmission is explicitly invited, the paper cannot return to POM — target another OM venue (M&SOM, Management Science, JOM, IJOPM, a domain journal).

## Checklist

- [ ] Department route and editor identified
- [ ] Both rigor and practice-relevance concerns separated in the letter
- [ ] Decision type classified (R&R vs. reject) correctly
- [ ] Resubmission invitation present? (only path back after a reject)
- [ ] Revised page budget plan if proceeding


## Review-risk pass for Production and Operations Management

Use this as a second-pass capability check. First lock the operational decision, the performance metric, and the implementable lever; then test whether the manuscript addresses POM reviewers who want operational insight tied to production, service, supply-chain, or platform decisions.

- **Primary move:** Turn likely reviewer objections into a ledger with response evidence, manuscript location, and the decision-maker who must be convinced first.
- **Decision ledger:** return `claim / evidence / blocker / next edit` rows so the next pass can patch the manuscript directly.
- **Neighbor test:** compare against Management Science for broader OR/MS theory, Operations Research for method-first optimization, MSOM for manufacturing/service operations depth; if the neighboring outlet has the stronger audience claim, recommend re-routing before polishing.
- **Verification floor:** before submission-ready advice, re-open `resources/official-source-map.md` for volatile rules and name the one unresolved fact that could change the recommendation.

## Output format

```
【Decision type】R&R (major/minor) / reject / reject-with-invitation
【Department】<department + editor>
【Concern axes】fit / contribution / method / practice relevance / presentation
【Resubmission allowed?】yes (invited) / no
【Best action】revise via pom-rebuttal / move to another OM venue
【Next step】pom-rebuttal (if R&R)
```
