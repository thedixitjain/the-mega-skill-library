# UIST Experiments

UIST does not have a single evaluation orthodoxy; it has a matching rule. The
evaluation must measure the claim the artifact makes, and different artifact types
make categorically different claims. The classic failure is the **ritual study**: a
12-participant SUS-and-task-time exercise bolted onto a toolkit paper whose actual
claim — "this abstraction lets developers build a class of things" — no usability
score can support.

## Match evaluation to claim type

| Artifact claim | Primary evidence | Supporting evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "This technique outperforms the status quo" (input, pointing, text entry) | Controlled within-subjects comparison against the real incumbent | Learning-curve data over sessions |
| "This hardware enables new sensing/actuation" | Technical characterization: accuracy, range, SNR, latency across conditions | Small usage session showing humans can operate it |
| "This toolkit lowers the floor / raises the ceiling" | Demonstration portfolio + developer study or expert walkthrough | Code-size/API comparisons, workshop deployments |
| "This pipeline makes X automatic" | Quantitative accuracy on held-out real inputs + failure taxonomy | End-to-end examples spanning input diversity |
| "This system supports task Y better" | Task-based study instrumented around Y | Log analysis, think-aloud excerpts |

Two smaller lanes are legitimate at UIST and often misused: **demonstration-only
evidence** carries a paper when the enabling novelty is extreme (the demo *is* the
result), and **expert sessions** (3-6 domain professionals in deep sessions) beat 20
novices when the system targets professionals.

## Technical evaluation discipline

The technical evaluation is the half UIST reviewers read most skeptically, because
they build things too:

- Characterize across the **operating envelope**, not the sweet spot: distances,
  angles, lighting, surface materials, user anthropometrics — whatever the physics of
  your system cares about.
- Report **distributions, not means**: median and 95th percentile latency; per-user
  accuracy spread. Interactive systems fail in the tails.
- Measure **with the interaction loop closed** where possible; camera-to-photon
  latency and recognition-in-context differ from component benchmarks.
- Include a **failure section**: conditions where recognition drops, actuation
  stalls, or tracking drifts. A measured failure boundary reads as competence.

## Baselines that respect the reader

Compare against what a skilled practitioner would actually use today — the shipping
technique, the standard library, the commercial device — not a strawman
reimplementation. When no incumbent exists (genuinely new capability), say so and
substitute ablations: which component of the pipeline buys which capability.

## Study mechanics for the systems context

- Counterbalance technique order; interaction studies carry strong carryover effects.
- Power the comparison for the effect you claim; 12 participants detect large
  effects only, so do not claim small ones from them.
- Report effect sizes with confidence intervals alongside any test statistic.
- Instrument the system itself — logs are free evidence and reviewers trust
  event-level data over recollection.
- IRB/ethics approval, compensation, and demographic reporting are expected whenever
  humans touch the system; plan approval months before the March deadline (see
  `uist-workflow`).

## Ablations for systems: which component buys which capability

Interactive systems are pipelines, and reviewers want the credit assignment:

- Disable or downgrade each novel component and re-measure the end-to-end
  behavior; report the deltas in one table.
- Substitute the naive version of each component (the off-the-shelf recognizer,
  the fixed calibration) to show the custom one earns its complexity.
- Where components interact, test the two-way combinations that your claims
  depend on, not the full factorial — and say that is what you did.
- Ablations also protect the rebuttal: "does the gain come from X or from Y?" is
  among the most common reviewer questions at this venue, and the answer must
  already exist by then (see `uist-author-response`).

## The objections this venue actually raises

| Recurring objection | Pre-emption |
|---|---|
| "The comparison baseline is a strawman" | Use the shipping incumbent; state its version and settings |
| "Latency/accuracy measured under ideal conditions" | Report the envelope and the tails, not the demo-day sweet spot |
| "The study tasks were designed around the system's strengths" | Include at least one task chosen from prior work's protocol |
| "n = 12 cannot support this claim" | Match claim size to power; concede small effects |
| "The applications are all variations of one scenario" | Diversify the portfolio across input contexts and user types |
| "No failure analysis" | A measured failure boundary section, always |

## Pre-submission evidence audit

```text
For each contribution claim C1..Cn in the introduction:
  [ ] name the evaluation section that tests it
  [ ] name the measure and the condition range
  [ ] name the comparison point (incumbent / ablation / none-with-justification)
  [ ] name where dispersion is reported (SD, CI, percentiles)
Orphan claims -> weaken the claim or add evidence
Orphan studies -> cut, or promote to a claim the intro actually makes
```

Run this audit against the video figure too: any capability the video shows that no
section measures is a question a reviewer will ask in exactly those words (rebuttal
implications in `uist-author-response`).

## Reporting

Put the strongest number in the abstract with its condition attached. In the body,
one summary table of the technical characterization beats four bar charts; per-cell
detail goes to the appendix, raw harness and logs to the supplement (packaging rules
in `uist-artifact-evaluation` and `uist-reproducibility`).

## Output format

```text
[Claim type] technique / hardware / toolkit / pipeline / task-support
[Evidence match] matched / partial mismatch / ritual-study warning
[Envelope coverage] <conditions characterized vs conditions claimed>
[Baseline honesty] real incumbent / ablation / missing
[Weakest link] <the claim most exposed in review + cheapest fix>
```
