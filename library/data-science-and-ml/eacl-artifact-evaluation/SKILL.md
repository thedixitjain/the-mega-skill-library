# EACL Artifact Evaluation

Use this to turn a paper's evidence into artifacts that survive review and become a public
release. EACL runs through ACL Rolling Review, so the artifact lives two lives: an **anonymized
supplement** attached at ARR submission, and a **public release** after commitment acceptance.
Both are audited against the Responsible NLP checklist. Reopen the current checklist before
packaging.

## The two lives of an EACL artifact

| Stage | Form | Must be | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARR submission | Anonymized `.zip`/`.tgz` supplement | Fully de-identified, self-contained | Authors |
| Commitment acceptance | Public repo + Anthology link | Licensed, versioned, reproducible | Authors |

Do not conflate them: the review supplement must contain **no author-identifying strings**,
while the public release must contain **exactly the identifying and licensing information the
supplement omitted**.

## What belongs in an EACL artifact

- **Code** to reproduce the headline tables, with a top-level entry point.
- **Data**: the dataset or a loader plus a documented path to it; if redistribution is
  restricted, document access precisely rather than implying release.
- **Prompts and decoding settings** verbatim for any LLM-based result — these are part of the
  method, not an afterthought.
- **Model outputs** retained so scores can be re-computed without re-running expensive models.
- **Annotation materials**: guidelines, interface, pay information, and inter-annotator
  agreement.

## Anonymized-supplement checklist

```text
[ ] No author names in paths, file headers, LICENSE, or notebook metadata
[ ] Git history stripped or repo re-initialized
[ ] No personal hosting URLs (Drive/Dropbox) that identify authors
[ ] Prompts + decoding params included verbatim
[ ] Model outputs included for re-scoring
[ ] A README that reproduces at least one reported table
[ ] Smoke-checked (see resources/code/README.md)
```

Run the shared smoke checker before upload:

```bash
python3 ../../../shared-resources/ml-conference-methods/code/check_repro_package.py /path/to/anonymous-supplement
```

## Licensing and documentation for the public release

- Choose a **license** appropriate to code (e.g. permissive) and data (respecting upstream
  dataset terms); the paper text should state it.
- Document **intended use** and known limitations of any released dataset — required by the
  checklist and expected by the European community's data-governance norms.
- Version the release with a tag that matches the camera-ready, so the Anthology PDF and the
  repo cannot drift.

## Multilingual and lower-resource specifics

- If the artifact covers lower-resourced languages, document **provenance and speaker/annotator
  context** carefully; thin documentation of a low-resource dataset is a common EACL reviewer
  concern.
- Keep language codes and scripts explicit (ISO codes, script variants) so the artifact is
  usable by others working on those languages.

## Output format

```text
[Artifact stage] Anonymized supplement / Public release
[Contents] <code/data/prompts/outputs/annotation coverage>
[Anonymization] <pass/fail with specific leaks>
[Reproduces] <which reported table the README regenerates>
[Licensing + docs] <license, dataset terms, intended-use note>
[Gaps] <what a reviewer could still not reproduce>
```
