# OOPSLA Workflow

OOPSLA gives a paper *two doors per year* into the same PACMPL volume — for
2026, October 10, 2025 (Round 1 → Issue OOPSLA1, published from April 1,
2026) and March 17, 2026 (Round 2 → Issue OOPSLA2, from October 1, 2026),
with all outcomes presented at SPLASH (Oakland, October 4–9, 2026; OOPSLA
talks October 5–7). Planning an OOPSLA campaign is therefore a routing
problem over rounds and revision outcomes, not a countdown to a single
deadline. As of 2026-07-08 the next open door is the 2027 volume's Round 1,
CFP not yet posted (待核实) — re-anchor every date below to live pages.

## Door choice: October vs March

| Factor | Favors the October round | Favors the March round |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revision insurance | Major Revision lands in March, **same volume** | Major Revision waits ~7 months for next volume's R1 |
| Publication timing | April issue; citable before the conference | October issue; publishes near conference time |
| Evidence maturity | Requires the evaluation done by early fall | Buys a winter of experiments |
| Team calendar | Summer build, fall write | Fall build, winter write |
| Talk lead time | Long runway to SPLASH | Acceptance close to travel booking |

Default heuristic: enter the earliest round where the *evidence* (not the
prose) is complete — the revision insurance of the early round compounds,
because the most likely non-accept outcome for solid work is a revision, and
same-volume revision is the cheapest one available anywhere in the SIGPLAN
family.

## Campaign state machine

```text
PLAN ──> ROUND N SUBMITTED ──> RESPONSE WINDOW ──> outcome?
  Accept ─────────────► CAMERA-READY ► ARTIFACT ► ISSUE ► SPLASH TALK
  Minor Revision ─────► execute list, same round ► (as Accept)
  Major Revision ─────► revise against expectations ► ROUND N+1 (same
                        reviewers where possible)
  Reject ─────────────► diagnose ► re-route (oopsla-topic-selection)
                        or rebuild ► a later round
Each transition has an owner and a date pulled from the live track page.
```

## Backward plan from a target round (T = deadline)

- **T-12 to T-8 weeks** — freeze claim list; run `oopsla-experiments`
  routing; start the demand matrix and reproducibility ledger.
- **T-8 to T-4** — full draft in the 23-page frame; related-work family
  sweep (`oopsla-related-work`); internal red-team read using the four
  SIGPLAN pillars.
- **T-4 to T-1** — style pass (`oopsla-writing-style`); appendix layering
  (`oopsla-supplementary`); Data-Availability Statement drafted from the
  ledger.
- **Final 72 hours** — the filing-day sequence in `oopsla-submission`.
- **Post-submission** — pre-write response scaffolding: the concerns you
  already know about, with PDF pointers ready for the four-day window.

## Revision-path budgeting

Reserve capacity *after* submission: the two most probable outcomes for
competent work — Minor and Major Revision — both demand engineering time on
a fixed clock. A team that disbands to other projects the week after the
deadline systematically converts Minor Revisions into missed opportunities.
Rule of thumb: hold 20% of the build team's time in reserve until the
outcome letter, then re-plan against the actual expectation list.

## Post-acceptance rail

Camera-ready reconciliation (`oopsla-camera-ready`) → artifact kick-the-tires
and badges (`oopsla-artifact-evaluation`) → Zenodo DOI into the final
statement → issue publication → SPLASH registration, talk, and optional
poster. The talk lands months after OOPSLA1 publication — plan it as a
presentation of known work, and budget travel to the SPLASH city early.

## Output format

```text
[Cycle anchor] current volume + next open round (live URL + date checked)
[Door choice] round + rationale from the table
[State] position in the state machine
[Reserve] revision capacity held + expiry
[Next transition] owner, date, blocking items
```
