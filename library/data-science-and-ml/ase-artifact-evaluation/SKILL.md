# ASE Artifact Evaluation

Convert the accepted paper's package into **badges**. ASE runs an **Artifact Evaluation** track
offering the **Artifacts Available** and **Artifacts Reusable** badges (ACM scheme). Because ASE
proceedings are indexed in **both IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library**, an earned badge appears
on the paper's front page in both. Evaluation happens on the track's **own deadline**, separate from
the research-track notification — stage the package before then.

## The two badges (verify the current call)

- **Artifacts Available** — the artifact is placed in a **publicly accessible archival repository**
  with a **DOI** (Zenodo, figshare, Software Heritage, or an institutional/ACM repository). A
  personal GitHub link alone is not archival; mint a DOI.
- **Artifacts Reusable** — the artifact significantly exceeds minimal functionality: it is
  **carefully documented and well-structured** so a third party can **reuse** the tool, not merely
  reproduce your tables. This is the higher bar and where automated-SE tools usually need the most
  work.
- Whether **Functional** and **Results Reproduced** badges are also offered at a given edition is
  **待核实** — confirm on the current Artifact Evaluation call.

## From the submission artifact to the badge artifact

The review-time (anonymized) artifact and the badge artifact are the same package matured. After
acceptance you can **de-anonymize** it, but the substance should already be there if you followed
`ase-reproducibility`.

```text
[De-anonymize]  restore the real tool name, authors, repository, license.
[Archive]       deposit in a DOI-issuing archive; the DOI is what "Available" certifies.
[Document]      README with exact run path, expected outputs, and a small worked example.
[Environment]   container/lockfile pinning deps + the exact tool commit; note hardware needs.
[Reuse story]   show how to run the tool on a NEW input, not just replay your experiments.
```

## Reusable is about strangers, not your tables

Evaluators judge **reusability**, so write for someone who wants to use your automation on their own
code:

- A clear entry point and documented inputs/outputs.
- Instructions to run on a **new** subject, with a template config.
- Sensible structure (source vs. data vs. scripts), an open **license**, and dependency pinning.
- Removal of dead scripts, secrets, and machine-specific paths.

## Evaluator-proofing checklist

```text
[Runs clean]   fresh environment (container) -> documented command -> expected output, no manual patching
[DOI]          archival deposit with a DOI + open license (for Available)
[Docs]         README covers install, run, expected results, and reuse on a new input (for Reusable)
[Provenance]   subject SHAs, dataset version, seeds, model IDs/dates + cached outputs included
[Scope honesty] hardware/time requirements and known limitations stated up front
[No secrets]   API keys, tokens, private paths removed
```

## Timing and scope

- The Artifact Evaluation deadline follows research-track acceptance; treat it as a real milestone,
  not an afterthought — a strong tool with a weak package earns no badge.
- Evaluators are often students and junior researchers on a schedule: an artifact that needs a live
  API key, unpinned dependencies, or your specific cluster will fail on setup regardless of the
  underlying quality.
- Badges are recognition, not re-review of the science; the paper is already accepted. The goal is
  durable, reusable automation.

## Output format

```text
[Target badges] Available / Reusable (Functional/Reproduced 待核实 for this edition)
[Archive] DOI minted? open license?
[Runs clean] fresh-env command -> expected output, no manual fixes?
[Reusable] docs + run-on-new-input path present?
[Provenance] SHAs / dataset version / seeds / model IDs / cached outputs bundled?
[Blockers] <ordered fixes before the AE deadline>
```
