# STAR Methods (molcell-star-methods)

## When to trigger

- The manuscript has a free-text Methods section (Molecular Cell requires STAR Methods).
- There is no **Key Resources Table**, or reagents lack identifiers/RRIDs/catalog numbers.
- The **Resource Availability** block is missing one of its required subsections.
- Statistics are scattered in legends with no consolidated analysis section.

**STAR Methods = Structured, Transparent, Accessible Reporting.** It is a Cell Press signature and is **mandatory** at Molecular Cell. Because Molecular Cell papers live or die on reagent- and construct-level detail, this is the single most scrutinized methods deliverable.

## Mandatory STAR Methods structure (exact order)

1. **Key Resources Table (KRT)**
2. **Resource Availability** — required subsections:
   a. **Lead Contact**
   b. **Materials Availability**
   c. **Data and Code Availability**
3. **Experimental Model and Subject Details** (or **Experimental Model and Study Participant Details**)
4. **Method Details**
5. **Quantification and Statistical Analysis** (QSA)

> Some versions add **Additional Resources** at the end. Confirm the current Cell Press STAR Methods structure and headings.

## 1. Key Resources Table (KRT)

A structured table listing **every** reagent and resource, grouped by category, each with its **source** and an **identifier** (RRID, catalog #, accession, DOI, or repository link). For a molecular-biology paper this table is dense — every plasmid, primer, and purified protein must appear.

| REAGENT or RESOURCE | SOURCE | IDENTIFIER |
|---------------------|--------|------------|
| **Antibodies** | | |
| Anti-X (clone, host) | Vendor / lab | Cat# ____; RRID:AB______ |
| **Bacterial and Virus Strains** | | |
| **Chemicals, Peptides, Recombinant Proteins** | | |
| Purified PROTEIN X (residues a–b) | This paper | N/A |
| **Critical Commercial Assays** | | |
| **Deposited Data** | | |
| ChIP-seq / RNA-seq, this paper | This paper | GEO: GSE______ |
| Cryo-EM map / model, this paper | This paper | EMDB: EMD-____ ; PDB: ____ |
| Mass spec, this paper | This paper | PRIDE: PXD______ |
| **Experimental Models: Cell Lines** | | |
| **Experimental Models: Organisms/Strains** | | |
| **Oligonucleotides** | | |
| sgRNA / primer / probe sequence | This paper | N/A |
| **Recombinant DNA** (plasmids) | | Addgene #______ |
| **Software and Algorithms** | | RRID:SCR______ / DOI |

Rules:
- [ ] Every antibody, cell line, strain, plasmid, oligo, purified protein, dataset, and software package appears.
- [ ] Antibodies carry a **catalog #** and **RRID** where available.
- [ ] Purified/recombinant proteins state the construct boundaries and tags.
- [ ] Cell lines and organisms identify source and validation/authentication (and mycoplasma status).
- [ ] Deposited data list the **accession/DOI** for *this paper's* data (see `molcell-data`).
- [ ] Software lists version and an identifier (RRID:SCR___ or DOI); custom code points to its archived repository.

## 2. Resource Availability (required subsections)

- **Lead Contact** — one named corresponding author who fields resource/reagent requests, with email.
- **Materials Availability** — how unique reagents (plasmids, cell lines, antibodies, purified proteins, mouse lines) are shared, via Addgene/repository or under an MTA; or "This study did not generate new unique reagents."
- **Data and Code Availability** — the standardized statement (data / code / additional information), each with a sentence (built in `molcell-data`).

All subsections must be present even when the answer is "none/not applicable."

## 3. Experimental Model and Subject Details

Organisms, strains, cell lines (sex, age, source, passage, authentication, mycoplasma), yeast/bacterial genotypes, recombinant expression hosts, patient/participant details (with ethics approvals and consent), housing and husbandry. State IRB/IACUC approvals and protocol numbers here.

## 4. Method Details

Step-by-step procedures in enough detail to reproduce, organized by technique with subheadings, referencing reagents by their KRT entries: protein expression and purification (constructs, tags, columns), reconstitution conditions, in-vitro assays, cryo-EM/crystallography data collection and processing, genomics library prep and pipelines, and any single-molecule setups. A Molecular Cell reader should be able to rebuild the biochemistry.

## 5. Quantification and Statistical Analysis (QSA)

A consolidated section: for each quantified result, the **statistical test**, definition of **n** and what it represents, **dispersion** (SD/SEM/CI), significance thresholds, software used, and how outliers/exclusions were handled. For structures, report resolution, refinement, and validation statistics; for genomics, normalization and replicate handling; for kinetics/single-molecule, the fitting model and number of events. Statistics in figure legends must match QSA.

## Output format

```
【KRT present】 yes/no — categories covered; antibodies w/ Cat#+RRID; purified proteins w/ constructs; deposited data w/ accession
【Resource Availability】 Lead Contact ☐ / Materials Availability ☐ / Data & Code Availability ☐
【Exp. Model & Subject Details】 organisms/lines/hosts/participants + ethics (IRB/IACUC)? yes/no
【Method Details】 reproducible, KRT-linked, purification/reconstitution described? yes/no
【QSA】 per-result test + n-definition + dispersion + software + structure/genomics stats? yes/no
【Gaps】 [...]
【Next】 molcell-data
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Do not** submit a free-text Methods section — Molecular Cell requires STAR Methods.
- **Do not** omit RRIDs/catalog numbers for antibodies and software.
- **Do not** leave purified-protein constructs, tags, or oligo sequences out of the KRT.
- **Do not** drop any Resource Availability subsection.
- **Do not** leave statistics only in legends — consolidate in QSA.

> The exact STAR Methods headings and KRT categories are set by Cell Press — confirm against the current STAR Methods author guidelines.
