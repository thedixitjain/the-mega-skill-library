# Emulo mine

Mine only real user-authored `.jsonl` sessions. Never synthesize a profile from rules files, memory, or a typed self-description.

1. Resolve `EMULO_PY` to `emulo.py` two directories above this skill, falling back to `./emulo.py` only in a direct checkout. Confirm Python 3 exists.
2. The full-history quality default reads all eligible history. Run read-only `python "$EMULO_PY" plugin preflight`, show valid sessions, post-dedupe source tokens, selected source tokens, cache hits, planned worker calls, and planned reducer calls, then wait for explicit cost approval before model work.
3. Only when the user explicitly asks for a quick preview, run preflight and prepare with `--preview`. Say this exactly before approval: `Quick preview creates a starter profile from selected history, not the full profile.` Never call preview the default, the full profile, or equivalent in quality to full-history mining.
4. Retain the displayed `approval_hash`. Run `python "$EMULO_PY" plugin prepare --approved-plan-hash HASH` with the exact approved mode. If the hash changed, show the new plan and obtain approval again. Retain the exact `run_id`, selected segment/report paths, and `pack_path`.
5. Run one fast worker for each uncached selected segment. Each reads only its segment and the per-segment contract in `MINING_PROMPT.md`, writes its assigned JSON report, and runs the read-only `plugin validate-report` command until accepted.
6. Cache each accepted report with `plugin cache-report`; stop on rejection.
7. Run one strongest-available reducer over only the validated reports and the combined reducer contract. It writes the complete assigned pack and self-validates with `plugin validate-pack`.
8. Activate only the validated pack with `plugin activate`, then run `plugin status` and render the card. Report active version, domain states, selected source tokens, actual worker/reducer passes, cache reuse, and targeted-deepen instructions.

Every prepared mode requires explicit approval of its displayed plan. Installation itself scans no logs and schedules zero mining calls. An identical update schedules zero additional Emulo mining calls, although the host task still has normal interaction overhead.

Adaptive receipt/scout stages are experimental and excluded from the Plugin release path. Run `--stage A` only when a developer explicitly requests experimental adaptive-recall testing; never select it automatically or use it for release calibration.
