# PRL Supplemental Material (prl-supplementary)

## When to trigger

- The Letter is over length and detail must move out of the body
- A reader cannot follow the Letter without consulting the SM
- You have derivations, extended datasets, or methods detail with no home
- You are unsure what is allowed in SM versus what must stay in the Letter
- Referees of a prior version asked for material that would bloat the body

## The stand-alone rule (non-negotiable)

The Letter must be **fully understandable on its own**. The Supplemental Material *supports* the Letter; it must never be *load-bearing* for the central claim. A reader who never opens the SM should still grasp the result, the evidence for it, and why it matters.

- The central claim, its key evidence, and the decisive control live in the **Letter**.
- The SM holds the exhaustive backup that a skeptical referee or replicator wants.
- Every SM section is **cited from the body** at the point it is relevant.

If removing the SM breaks the argument, the partition is wrong — pull the essential piece back into the Letter (and trim elsewhere via `prl-length-management`).

## What belongs in Supplemental Material

| Content                                            | Home  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Full derivations / lengthy algebra                  | SM    |
| Extended datasets, additional samples, full sweeps  | SM    |
| Detailed apparatus, growth, calibration             | SM    |
| Secondary controls and robustness checks            | SM    |
| Full error budget / systematics breakdown           | SM    |
| Numerical convergence studies                        | SM    |
| Additional figures / movies / large tables          | SM    |
| The central claim and its decisive evidence          | Letter|
| The one control ruling out the obvious artifact      | Letter|
| The headline uncertainty                             | Letter|

## SM organization

- Mirror the Letter's logic: order SM sections to match the order they are cited.
- Give SM sections their own clear headings (S1, S2, ...) and self-contained captions.
- SM references: include the works the SM itself needs; follow current APS practice on how SM citations are counted and listed (verify).
- Label SM figures/tables distinctly (Fig. S1, Table S1) to avoid confusion with the Letter.
- Keep the SM honest: it is peer-reviewed alongside the Letter, not a place to hide weak results.

## Checklist

- [ ] The Letter is understandable without ever opening the SM
- [ ] No central-claim evidence is *only* in the SM
- [ ] Every SM section is cited from the body at the relevant point
- [ ] SM sections ordered to match their citation order in the Letter
- [ ] SM figures/tables labeled S1, S2, ... distinctly
- [ ] Derivations, extended data, secondary controls live in SM
- [ ] SM is internally consistent in notation with the Letter
- [ ] SM citation handling follows current APS practice

## Anti-patterns

- A Letter that silently depends on the SM to be understood
- Burying the decisive control or key uncertainty in the SM
- An SM that is a disorganized dump rather than a structured appendix
- SM figures referenced out of order or never cited from the body
- Notation drift between Letter and SM
- Using the SM to smuggle in claims the referees did not vet

## Output format

```
【Letter stands alone】yes / fix (pull back: ...)
【SM sections】S1: ... / S2: ... (cited from body?)
【Central evidence only in SM?】none / move back: ...
【SM figure/table labels】S-prefixed?  yes / fix
【Notation consistent Letter↔SM】yes / fix
【Next】prl-writing-style or prl-length-management
```
