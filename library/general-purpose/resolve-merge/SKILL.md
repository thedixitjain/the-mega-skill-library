# Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. Verify `MERGE_HEAD` or `REBASE_HEAD`; otherwise stop with `No merge in progress.`
2. Before any write, list conflicts and classify each as AUTO or JUDGMENT.
3. AUTO requires mechanical proof; default to JUDGMENT. AUTO cases:
   - Sides byte-identical (`git show :2:<f>` vs `:3:<f>`) or differing only in whitespace/EOL → take either.
   - AU → `git add`, but `git rm` if its slug already exists in theirs at another number (duplicate).
   - Lock file → checkout one side, regenerate via the package manager.
   - `CHANGELOG.md` → merge unique entries, dedupe, keep category order.
4. For numbered plans/chronicles, keep THEIRS numbers. Renumber colliding OURS-only files from the next free number without gaps or duplicates; fix self, research, and cross-references.
5. Show every conflict with file, code, action, and classification. Ask once: Approve / Modify / Abort. Abort writes nothing.
6. Apply approved AUTO actions; report only counts and failures.
7. For each JUDGMENT file, show exact OURS and THEIRS hunks plus the proposed merge. Ask Approve / Edit / Skip; Skip leaves it conflicted.
8. A file failure stays conflicted and goes under `Skipped`; continue with others.
9. Verify no tracked conflict markers, valid numbering and references when relevant, and known build/lint checks.
10. Report `N resolved: X AUTO, Y JUDGMENT; Skipped: …`, then hand off to `/commit` without committing. Stop on failed checks.
