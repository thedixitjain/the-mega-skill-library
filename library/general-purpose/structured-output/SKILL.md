# Structured Output

## When To Use
- When finalizing any review or analysis.
- To format findings in a consistent way that names specific next steps.
- Before presenting results to stakeholders or committing them to documentation.

## When NOT To Use

- Capturing evidence during analysis - use proof-of-work
- Reviewing changes - use diff-analysis or review-core first

## Activation Patterns
**Trigger Keywords**: format, structure, deliverable, report, organize, present, consistent
**Contextual Cues**:
- "format this as a report" or "structure the output"
- "create a deliverable" or "present these findings"
- "organize this consistently" or "standardize the format"
- "make this actionable" or "prepare for stakeholders"

**Auto-Load When**: Finalizing any analysis deliverable or when consistent formatting is requested.

## Required TodoWrite Items
1. `structured-output:template-selected`
2. `structured-output:findings-formatted`
3. `structured-output:actions-assigned`
4. `structured-output:appendix-attached`

Mark each item complete as you finish the corresponding step.

## Step 1: Select Template (`structured-output:template-selected`)
- Choose output format based on deliverable type:
  - **Review Report**: Summary, Findings, Recommendations, Evidence.
  - **PR Description**: Summary, Changes, Test Plan, Notes.
  - **Release Notes**: Highlights, Breaking Changes, Fixes, Credits.
  - **Incident Report**: Timeline, Impact, Root Cause, Remediation.
- Confirm audience and required detail level.

## Step 2: Format Findings (`structured-output:findings-formatted`)
- Use consistent finding structure:
  ```markdown
  ### [SEVERITY] Finding Title
  **Location**: file.rs:123
  **Anchor**: `verbatim source text copied from line 123`
  **Category**: Security | Performance | Correctness | Style
  **Description**: Brief explanation of the issue.
  **Evidence**: [E1, E2] - Reference to evidence log.
  **Recommendation**: Specific remediation steps.
  ```
  **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
- Severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO.
- Order findings by severity, then by file location.
- **Anchor is mandatory and grounds the finding.** Copy the exact
  source text at `Location` (not a paraphrase). It is what a second
  pass re-reads to confirm the finding is real. A finding whose anchor
  does not appear at its cited line is treated as a hallucination and
  dropped. The check is mechanical: `imbue:review-core` Step 6 runs
  `plugins/imbue/scripts/citation_verifier.py` over the findings.

## Step 3: Assign Actions (`structured-output:actions-assigned`)
- Convert findings to action items with assignee and priority:
  ```markdown
  ## Action Items
  - [ ] [HIGH] Fix SQL injection in auth.py:45 (@security-team, P1)
  - [ ] [MEDIUM] Add input validation to API endpoint (@backend, P2)
  - [ ] [LOW] Update deprecated dependency (@devops, P3)
  ```
  **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
- Include owner assignment where known.
- Add priority indicators (P1/P2/P3) for triage.
- Note dependencies between actions.

## Step 4: Attach Appendix (`structured-output:appendix-attached`)
- Compile supporting materials:
  ```markdown
  ## Appendix
  ### A. Commands Run
  [Full evidence log from imbue:proof-of-work]

  ### B. External References
  [Citations and documentation links]

  ### C. Raw Data
  [Large outputs, full diffs, or data exports]
  ```
  **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
- Keep main report concise; details in appendix.
- validate appendix is navigable with clear section headers.

## Output Quality Checklist
Before finalizing:
- [ ] Every finding carries a verbatim `Anchor` the citation verifier
      resolved (no unverified findings ship).
- [ ] All findings have evidence references.
- [ ] Severity levels are justified.
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and name the next step.
- [ ] No orphaned sections or placeholder text.
- [ ] Format renders correctly in target medium (GitHub, Confluence, etc.).

## Exit Criteria
- Todos completed with formatted deliverable.
- Output follows selected template structure.
- Stakeholders can act on findings without clarification.
