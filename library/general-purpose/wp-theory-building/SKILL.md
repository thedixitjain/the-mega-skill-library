# Theory & Argument Building (wp-theory-building)

At World Politics a finding is not a contribution until it is attached to **theory the field can carry
to other cases.** The journal asks articles to "significantly advance theoretical debates" — so this
skill turns case evidence into a portable argument: explicit mechanisms, scope conditions, and
observable implications that hold across comparative or IR settings.

## When to trigger

- The empirics are strong but the "so what / why it travels" is thin
- A reviewer said the paper is "atheoretical," "ad hoc," or "just a single-case story"
- You need to state mechanisms, assumptions, and scope conditions explicitly
- Formal modeling: deciding what to model for a comparative/IR puzzle

## Build the argument (by mode of work)

### Empirical paper with a theory
1. **Concept** — define the key constructs precisely (regime type, institution, alliance, identity);
   distinguish from neighbors and travel-test the concept across cases (avoid concept stretching).
2. **Mechanism** — the causal story: who does what, under what incentives/constraints, in what
   institutional or international setting.
3. **Observable implications** — what we should see if the mechanism operates across cases (and what we
   should *not* see). These become the tests in `wp-research-design`.
4. **Scope conditions** — where the argument holds and where it does not. Portability ≠ universality;
   say which regimes, regions, or periods it covers.

### Formal / game-theoretic paper
- State the **substantive comparative/IR puzzle** the model addresses before the setup.
- Keep assumptions **transparent and motivated**; flag which results are robust to which assumptions.
- Translate equilibrium predictions into **comparative statics** a reader can test across cases.
- Say what the model **buys**: a non-obvious prediction or a unifying logic for a cross-case pattern.

## The "travels" test (World Politics–specific)

Ask: *Could a scholar studying a different country, region, or international setting import this
mechanism and expect it to bite?* If yes, you have a comparative/IR contribution. If the argument only
works for your exact case, generalize the logic or reframe (back to `wp-topic-selection`). Concept
stretching is the opposite failure — a concept so broad it no longer travels meaningfully.

## Anti-patterns

- "Hypothesizing after results are known" (HARKing) — state theory before tests
- A model with opaque assumptions chosen to produce the desired result
- Mechanisms named but never made observable across cases
- Universal claims with no scope conditions, or concept stretching to force generality
- Burying the argument under the empirics — the contribution must be stated plainly

## Referee-pushback patterns and the venue-specific fix

World Politics rewards arguments that advance theoretical debates, so the sharpest objections are
about generativity and portability.

| Referee objection | The fix this skill drives |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| "Empirical but not theoretically generative" | Attach the finding to a mechanism the field can carry to other cases; state a non-obvious prediction |
| "Scope conditions unstated" | Name where it holds and where it fails; portability is not universality |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A hypothetical finding — "aid cut, then the incumbent fell" — becomes portable:

```text
Concept:   external-rent dependence (distinct from total revenue)
Mechanism: rents fund the coalition; a cut shrinks side-payments → elite defection
Scope:     holds where rents are fungible and the coalition is narrow
```

The single case is now a case *of* coalition-funding dynamics, which lets the argument travel.
(Confirm contribution expectations against current guidelines.)

## Operating pass for World Politics

Run this as a concrete capability pass. First lock the political mechanism, case scope, evidence warrant, and comparative or international implication; then test whether the manuscript addresses comparative and international politics reviewers who expect a big political question, credible evidence, and theory that travels beyond one case.

- **Primary move:** Return a claim-evidence-risk ledger; every recommendation must point to a manuscript location or missing artifact.
- **Decision ledger:** return `claim / evidence / blocker / next edit` rows so the next pass can patch the manuscript directly.
- **Sibling comparison:** compare against International Organization for IR institutions/political economy, Journal of Politics for wider political science, Comparative Political Studies for comparative breadth; if the neighboring outlet has the stronger audience claim, recommend re-routing before polishing.
- **Verification floor:** before submission-ready advice, re-open `resources/official-source-map.md` for volatile rules and name the one unresolved fact that could change the recommendation.

## Output format

```
【Core claim】one sentence
【Mechanism】the causal/logical story and its setting
【Assumptions】(formal) the load-bearing ones
【Observable implications】testable consequences → research-design
【Scope conditions】which cases / regimes / periods it covers
【Travels?】who else (which cases) can use this argument
【Next】wp-research-design
```
