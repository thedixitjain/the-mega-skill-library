# Concurrency Patterns

Analysis of concurrent and async code patterns in Rust,
grounded in the concurrency cost hierarchy.

## Concurrency Cost Hierarchy

"Acquiring a mutex isn't slow; contention is slow."
Before reviewing concurrency code, classify each
synchronization point by its cost tier.

| Level | Name | Approx Cost | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | Thread-local | ~2 ns | No atomics at all; per-thread state |
| 1 | Uncontended atomics | ~10 ns | Atomic ops, no cross-core sharing |
| 2 | Contended atomics | ~40-400 ns | Cache-line transfer between cores |
| 3 | Syscalls | ~1 us | Kernel transitions on lock paths |
| 4 | Context switches | ~10 us | Blocking locks, scheduler involvement |
| 5 | Catastrophe | ~ms+ | Spinning on oversubscribed systems |
| 6 | Kernel page fault | ~100-400 ms | Paged-out buffer re-faulted on access |

Levels 3-5 are performance bugs. Level 6 is invisible in
task scheduler traces (tokio-console shows tasks scheduling
in microseconds while the actual latency occurs in the
kernel page fault handler). Target Level 2 as the default.
Achieve Level 1 through contention reduction. Level 0
requires architectural redesign (per-thread computation
with periodic merges).

**Level 6: kernel paging latency**: Long-lived Tokio
runtimes that co-reside with large heap users (e.g., ML
model weights) are at risk: the kernel may page out
latency-sensitive buffers during idle periods. When audio
or ring-ring buffers page back in on the next access, the
page fault adds 100–400 ms of p99 latency with no Tokio
trace signal.

Detection: production-only latency spikes, no reproduction
on dev box, `perf stat` shows elevated `page-faults` on
the audio/buffer threads.

Fix: `libc::mlock` on the buffer pages. See
`modules/unsafe-audit.md` for the full production checklist
(RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, page alignment, ENOMEM fallback).

**Key insight**: Performance is dominated by atomic
instruction count, not total instruction count. An
algorithm with 9x more total instructions but the
same number of atomics performs identically.

### What to Flag in Review

- **Level 5**: Fair spin-locks on thread pools larger
  than core count. Always flag.
- **Level 4**: `std::sync::Condvar` wake patterns that
  convoy. Flag when hot path.
- **Level 3**: `sched_yield()` or `thread::yield_now()`
  in lock loops. Suggest backoff or parking.
- **Level 2 (avoidable)**: Atomic RMW on shared counter
  when per-thread counters and merge would suffice.
- **False sharing**: Independent atomics on the same
  cache line (64 bytes). Suggest `#[repr(align(64))]`
  or `crossbeam_utils::CachePadded`.

## Synchronization Primitives

Review primitives usage:

- `Arc`, `Mutex`, `RwLock`
- `Atomic*` types and ordering (`Relaxed` vs `SeqCst`)
- `tokio::sync` (mpsc, broadcast, watch, Semaphore)
- `Send`/`Sync` bounds
- `parking_lot` vs `std::sync` trade-offs

### Memory Ordering Review

Check ordering is neither too weak nor too strong:

- `Relaxed`: Counters, statistics (no cross-variable
  ordering needed)
- `Acquire`/`Release`: Publish/consume patterns,
  one-shot flags
- `SeqCst`: Only when total order across multiple
  atomics is required (rare; flag overuse)

## Async Patterns

Check async code:

- No blocking in async functions
- Proper `spawn_blocking` usage
- Guards dropped before awaiting
- Cancellation safety
- Task spawning patterns

## Task Orchestration vs `select!`

Flag hand-rolled multi-task orchestration that a single
`tokio::select!` loop would express more safely. The
anti-pattern: a function spawns several tasks that coordinate
a shared sink through an `mpsc` channel, then tears them down
manually with consecutive `JoinHandle::abort()` calls plus a
channel drop and a join. The manual teardown is fragile (a
missed `abort` leaks a task, teardown order matters) and the
channel is frequently `unbounded`, an unbounded-memory path
under a slow consumer.

### Detection Heuristic

Flag a function that:

1. contains two or more `tokio::spawn` calls whose
   `JoinHandle`s are bound to locals, and
2. ends with two or more consecutive `<handle>.abort()`
   calls, optionally followed by `drop(<sender>)` and/or
   `<handle>.await`, and
3. shares a sink (often a `futures::stream::SplitSink`)
   across those tasks via an `mpsc` channel.

Report it as a Concurrency finding recommending a `select!`
rewrite.

### Before and After

```rust
// Before: three tasks, channel plumbing, manual teardown
let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::unbounded_channel();
let writer = tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Some(m) = rx.recv().await {
        if sink.send(m).await.is_err() { break; }
    }
});
let forward = tokio::spawn(/* source.next() -> tx */);
let injector = tokio::spawn(/* periodic sends via tx */);
// ... main loop ...
injector.abort();
forward.abort();
drop(tx);
let _ = writer.await;

// After: one loop, structural cancellation on scope exit
let mut source_open = true;
loop {
    tokio::select! {
        _ = next_tick(&mut ticker) => { /* inject */ }
        c = control.next() => { /* forward; break on close */ }
        s = source.next(), if source_open => {
            /* sink.send(..).await; mark closed on end */
        }
    }
}
// loop exit drops every stream: nothing to abort, no channel
```

The rewrite makes cancellation structural, serializes access
to the single sink (removing the channel-plus-writer-task
workaround for an unshareable `SplitSink`), and replaces the
unbounded channel with `select!`'s natural backpressure.

### Caveats the Finding Must State

- Only suggest the rewrite when the branch futures are
  cancel-safe. `StreamExt::next`, `Interval::tick`, and
  `mpsc::Receiver::recv` are; a `MutexGuard` held across
  `.await` is not. Non-cancel-safe `.send().await`s belong in
  branch bodies, which run to completion.
- `select!` head-of-line-blocks sibling branches while one
  branch body awaits. Acceptable when a stalled peer would
  end the session anyway, but call it out so the suggestion
  is not applied blindly.

## Best Practices

```rust
// Good: Drop guard before await
async fn update(data: Arc<Mutex<Data>>) {
    let value = {
        let guard = data.lock().await;
        guard.value.clone()
    }; // Guard dropped
    process(value).await;
}

// Good: Cache-padded to prevent false sharing
use crossbeam_utils::CachePadded;

struct Counters {
    reads: CachePadded<AtomicU64>,
    writes: CachePadded<AtomicU64>,
}
```

## Contention Reduction Patterns

When review finds Level 2+ contention on hot paths:

1. **Shard the lock**: `DashMap`, `ShardedLock`, or
   manual sharding by key hash
2. **Per-thread accumulation**: Thread-local counters
   merged at read time (Level 2 to Level 0)
3. **Read-copy-update (RCU)**: `arc-swap` for
   read-heavy, write-rare data
4. **Lock-free structures**: `crossbeam` queues and
   deques when contention dominates

## Deadlock Prevention

Identify potential deadlocks:

- Lock ordering consistency
- Nested locks
- Await points while holding locks
- Circular dependencies

## Data Race Detection

Check for:

- `static mut` misuse
- Shared mutable state
- Missing synchronization
- Race conditions

## Send/Sync Bounds

Verify:

- Proper trait bounds
- Thread safety guarantees
- Cross-thread data transfer
- Closure captures

## Common Issues

- Blocking in async context
- Guards held across await points
- Inconsistent lock ordering
- Missing bounds on generics
- Unsafe Send/Sync implementations
- `SeqCst` used everywhere (usually `Acquire`/`Release`
  suffices; `SeqCst` adds unnecessary fence cost)
- Spinning without backoff on oversubscribed systems
- False sharing between independent atomics
- Multi-task orchestration with manual `abort()` teardown
  where one `select!` loop suffices
