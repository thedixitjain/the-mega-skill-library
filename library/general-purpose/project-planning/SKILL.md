## Delegation

For detailed task planning workflows, this skill delegates to `spec-kit:task-planning` as the canonical implementation. Use this skill for quick planning needs; use spec-kit for thorough project plans.

## When To Use

- After specification phase completes
- Need to design system architecture
- Need task breakdown for implementation
- Planning sprints and resource allocation
- Converting requirements into concrete tasks
- Defining component interfaces and dependencies

## When NOT To Use

- No specification exists yet (use `Skill(attune:project-specification)` first)
- Still exploring problem space (use `Skill(attune:project-brainstorming)` instead)
- Ready to execute existing plan (use `Skill(attune:project-execution)` instead)
- Need to adjust running project (update plan incrementally, don't restart)

## Integration

**With superpowers**:
- Uses `Skill(superpowers:writing-plans)` for structured planning
- Applies checkpoint-based execution patterns
- Uses dependency analysis framework

**Without superpowers**:
- Standalone planning methodology
- Task breakdown templates
- Dependency tracking patterns

## Quality Checks

Before completing plan:

- ✅ All architecture components documented
- ✅ File Structure section present before tasks
- ✅ All task files appear in File Structure table
- ✅ All FRs mapped to tasks
- ✅ All tasks have acceptance criteria
- ✅ Dependencies are acyclic
- ✅ Effort estimates provided
- ✅ Critical path identified
- ✅ Risks assessed with mitigations
- ✅ Sprints balanced by capacity

## Record the Tradeoff (decision journal)

Planning is where architecture and scope decisions get made: the pattern
chosen, the dependency accepted, the work deferred. Record each decision that
had real alternatives to `docs/tradeoffs.md` (draft and confirm):

- If leyline is installed, invoke `Skill(leyline:decision-journal)` and append
  a tradeoff entry (the decision, the options weighed, and what was
  sacrificed; set `phase` to `plan`). Show the draft; append on confirmation.
- Fallback (leyline absent): append to `docs/tradeoffs.md` using the in-file
  ENTRY TEMPLATE; assign the next `TR-NNN` id.

## Post-Completion: Workflow Continuation (REQUIRED)

**Automatic Trigger**: After Quality Checks pass and `docs/implementation-plan.md` is saved, MUST auto-invoke the next phase.

**When continuation is invoked**:
1. Verify `docs/implementation-plan.md` exists and is non-empty
2. Display checkpoint message to user:
   ```
   Implementation plan complete. Saved to docs/implementation-plan.md.
   Proceeding to execution phase...
   ```
3. Invoke next phase:
   ```
   Skill(attune:project-execution)
   ```

**Bypass Conditions** (ONLY skip continuation if ANY true):
- `--standalone` flag was provided by the user
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` does not exist or is empty (phase failed)
- User explicitly requests to stop after planning

**Do NOT prompt the user for confirmation**: this is a lightweight checkpoint, not an interactive gate. The user can always interrupt if needed.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] `docs/implementation-plan.md` exists, is non-empty, and passes Quality
  Checks (acyclic dependencies, FRs mapped, critical path identified).
- [ ] Architecture and scope decisions with alternatives are recorded to
  `docs/tradeoffs.md`.
- [ ] The execution phase is auto-invoked unless a bypass condition holds.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

If you find circular dependencies in your task graph, break one of the tasks into smaller sub-tasks. If sprint capacity is consistently exceeded, re-estimate tasks using the Fibonacci scale or reduce sprint scope.
