# Evidence Appraisal & Balance (arecon-evidence-standards)

## When to trigger

- The framework is set and you are filling cells with conflicting empirical results
- You must decide whether "the literature finds X" is actually supported, or only loosely
- The field has rival schools, a live controversy, or estimates that disagree
- You are a contributor to this literature and worry the review tilts toward your own work

## Appraising evidence you did not produce

An ARE review **runs no identification of its own** — there is no design to defend, no replication package of your data. Instead you act as the field's **referee-of-record for adjacent readers**: you judge how much weight each primary study can bear so the review weighs the evidence correctly. Make the appraisal explicit, not implicit:

- **DID / event study:** does the cited paper use TWFE on staggered timing without addressing heterogeneity bias? A study that predates Callaway–Sant'Anna / Sun–Abraham corrections may not support the magnitude you attribute to it — flag it.
- **IV:** is the first stage strong and the exclusion restriction defended, or is it a convenience instrument? Weak-IV results carry less weight in your synthesis.
- **RDD:** density/manipulation checks, bandwidth robustness — a fragile RDD is a fragile data point.
- **Structural / calibration:** are the parameters identified and the counterfactual policy-invariant, or is it calibration presented as estimation?
- **Experiments:** pre-registration, balance, attrition, multiple-hypothesis adjustment, external validity.

You are not re-running these — you are **rating their credibility** in the evidence matrix so the review's conclusions track the *best* evidence, not the *loudest* paper.

## Execution bridge — when rating is not enough

A few moments in an ARE review justify running something instead of only rating it: a survey table pools estimates and wants a formal meta-analytic average or publication-bias check; a pivotal magnitude predates the staggered-DiD corrections and its replication data are public, so you can report what `callaway_santanna` or `bacon_decomposition` actually does to it rather than speculate; or a weak-instrument worry could be settled by an `effective_f_test` on the archived first stage. For these, hand off to [`execution-with-mcp`](../../../shared-resources/empirical-methods/execution-with-mcp.md), which maps each design and reviewer objection to the callable StatsPAI / Stata MCP chain (`detect_design` → fit with `as_handle=true` → `audit_result`). Label any such figure as your re-analysis, and never report a number you did not compute.

## Weighing, not vote-counting

Conflicting results are reconciled by **credibility and by what each study estimates**, never by tallying "7 studies positive, 4 negative." Two estimates that disagree often measure different objects (different populations, estimands, time horizons); say so, and let the framework's cells carry the distinction. A pooled "consensus" across non-comparable designs manufactures false agreement that ARE's methodologically literate readers will catch.

## Comprehensiveness vs. selectivity: the ARE contract

A review must be **comprehensive in coverage** yet **selective in emphasis** — and stay accessible in ~25–40 pages. Tier the corpus:

| Tier | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| **Foundational / field-defining** | discussed in text, with what they established and their limits |
| **Important contributions** | grouped and weighed within framework cells; cited with their finding |
| **Confirmatory / incremental** | cited in clusters ("see also …") to show coverage without bloating prose |
| **Tangential** | cited only where they bear on a specific claim |

Comprehensiveness is proven by the citation set + saturation log (`arecon-literature-synthesis`); selectivity is exercised in the prose.

## Fairness and the self-citation trap

ARE referees are frequently the surveyed authors themselves, so balance is strategic as well as ethical:

- **Steelman every camp.** State each school's strongest case in terms its proponents would accept *before* noting weaknesses.
- **Attribute ideas to originators**, not popularizers (a recurring referee complaint).
- **Handle live controversies without resolving by fiat.** Lay out the disagreement, what evidence would settle it, and where your own read sits — labelled as *your read*, not as consensus.
- **Audit self-citation.** Your own work appears at the tier its importance to the field warrants — no more; rivals get their strongest statement; a reader who does not know the author cannot tell from the emphasis.

## Checklist

- [ ] Each pivotal primary study carries a credibility appraisal (design, identification, robustness)
- [ ] Outdated or fragile designs flagged where the review leans on their magnitudes
- [ ] Conflicting findings reconciled by credibility + estimand, not vote-counting
- [ ] Corpus tiered; prose emphasis matches tier; coverage provable from the saturation log
- [ ] Every rival school stated at its strongest before critique (steelman)
- [ ] Idea attribution traces to originators
- [ ] Live controversies presented with what evidence would settle them; author's read labelled
- [ ] Self-citation audited: own work at warranted tier; emphasis is identity-blind

## Anti-patterns

- Citing a study's headline number without noting its identification is now known to be biased
- Vote-counting conflicting results instead of weighing credibility and estimand
- Pooling non-comparable estimates into one "the literature shows…" magnitude
- Comprehensiveness theatre: equal-length summaries of every paper (no editorial judgment)
- Strawmanning the camp the author disagrees with
- A review that doubles as the author's CV (the most-punished ARE balance failure)
- Declaring a live controversy "resolved" by assertion rather than the evidentiary state

## Output format

```text
【Credibility appraisal】pivotal studies rated (design/identification/robustness)? Y/N
【Conflict handling】reconciled by credibility + estimand (not vote-count)? Y/N
【Tiering】corpus split foundational/important/confirmatory/tangential? Y/N
【Comprehensiveness】saturation log supports "nothing important missing"? Y/N
【Steelman】each rival school stated at its strongest? Y/N
【Controversy】evidence-to-settle stated; author's read labelled? Y/N
【Self-citation audit】own work at warranted tier; emphasis identity-blind? Y/N
【Next step】→ arecon-tables-figures (who-found-what tables) → arecon-writing-style
