# Spec Merger

Before the final `executing → closing` transition, delta specs (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED) must be merged into the main spec base. **Specs that aren't synced become lies.** A change already in `closing` must not be routed to `spec-merger`.

## Execution-State Guard

Before `ssf sync` or any other write, run
`npx --yes --package spec-superflow@0.11.0 ssf state get <change-dir> state`.
Continue only when the persisted state is exactly `executing`. If it is
`closing` → STOP: "Closing is terminal. Do not route this change to spec-merger;
synchronization belongs before the final executing → closing transition." For
any other state, or if the state cannot be read → STOP and route through
`workflow-start`; do not perform side effects.

## Pre-Flight Checks

### Conflict Detection
Run `npx --yes --package spec-superflow@0.11.0 ssf sync <change-dir>`. If conflicts are detected (same requirement modified by multiple changes), present the conflict list to the user for resolution order.

## Sync Process

### Step 1: Identify Deltas
Each `specs/<capability>/spec.md` under the change folder contains delta operations under `## ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements`.

### Step 2: Apply by Operation

**ADDED**: Append to `specs/<capability>/spec.md`. Create the main spec if it doesn't exist. Insert before any REMOVED section.

**MODIFIED**: Match on `### Requirement: <name>`. Replace description and scenarios. Preserve original in a `### Previous version` subsection. Flag if requirement doesn't exist in main spec.

**REMOVED**: Move to `## Removed` section with deprecation note: reason, migration, and change name. Flag if requirement doesn't exist.

**RENAMED**: Match old name, change header to new name, add `_Renamed from <old> in <change>_`. Flag if new name collides with existing.

### Step 3: Conflict Detection
Before executing, detect:
- Same requirement modified by multiple unsynced changes → manual resolution
- RENAMED target collides with existing requirement → manual resolution
- MODIFIED/REMOVED targeting nonexistent requirements → flag

### Step 4: Execute Merge
Apply changes. Do NOT delete delta specs — they remain for traceability. After merge, validate: no duplicate requirement names, no orphaned references, REMOVED section clearly separated.

### Step 5: Report
Output sync report table: Capability, ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED counts, Status (✓/⚠). Summary with totals and unresolved conflicts.

## Guardrails

- Do not delete delta spec files (historical record)
- Do not auto-resolve conflicts across changes
- Do not merge specs for unverified changes
- Validate main spec consistency after each capability merge

## Post-Sync

1. Report results. If no conflicts → ready to archive. If conflicts → user resolves before archive.
2. Change folder (including deltas) remains for traceability.
3. Record that merging is complete so the `executing → closing` guard allows closure:
   ```bash
   npx --yes --package spec-superflow@0.11.0 ssf state set <change-dir> spec_merged true
   ```
   (If the change had no delta sections, still set `spec_merged true` — there was nothing to merge.)

## Exception Handling

- **Parse failures**: Report file and section. Do not attempt partial merges.
- **No deltas**: If change has no delta sections, report nothing to merge and exit cleanly.
- **User interruption**: On resume, check for merge conflict markers before proceeding.
