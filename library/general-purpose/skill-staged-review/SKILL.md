> **Host: Codex CLI** — This skill was designed for Claude Code and adapted for Codex.
> Cross-reference commands use installed skill names in Codex rather than `/octo:*` slash commands.
> Use the active Codex shell and subagent tools. Do not claim a provider, model, or host subagent is available until the current session exposes it.
> For host tool equivalents, see `skills/blocks/codex-host-adapter.md`.


## Execution Contract (MANDATORY - CANNOT SKIP)

This generated Codex skill preserves an enforced workflow contract from the source skill.

**PROHIBITED:**
- Do not summarize, simulate, or skip the referenced workflow command when this skill requires execution.
- Do not claim provider output or validation artifacts exist without checking the actual files or command output.
- Do not continue silently when a required provider, command, or host capability is unavailable; report the unavailable dependency and use a supported fallback.


# Two-Stage Review Pipeline

Separates **spec compliance** (did you build the right thing?) from **code quality**
(did you build it right?). Stage 1 must pass before Stage 2 runs.


## Stage 1: Spec Compliance

Validates the implementation against the intent contract.

### Step 1: Load Intent Contract

```bash
INTENT_FILE=".claude/session-intent.md"
if [[ -f "$INTENT_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "Intent contract found: $INTENT_FILE"
  cat "$INTENT_FILE"
else
  echo "WARNING: No intent contract found at $INTENT_FILE"
  echo "Skipping Stage 1 — proceeding to Stage 2 (code quality) only."
fi
```

**If no intent contract exists:** Warn the user and skip to Stage 2. Do NOT fabricate
success criteria — the contract must exist from a prior workflow.

### Step 2: Validate Success Criteria

For each success criterion in the intent contract:

1. **Read the criterion** from the `## Success Criteria` section
2. **Find evidence** in the codebase that the criterion is met
3. **Mark status:**
   - `[PASS]` — Evidence confirms criterion is met
   - `[FAIL]` — Evidence shows criterion is NOT met
   - `[PARTIAL]` — Partially met, gaps identified

Present results:

```markdown
## Stage 1: Spec Compliance

### Success Criteria Check

#### Good Enough Criteria
- [PASS] Criterion 1: <how it was met>
- [FAIL] Criterion 2: <why not met, what's missing>

#### Exceptional Criteria
- [PARTIAL] Criterion 1: <what's done, what's remaining>
```

### Step 3: Validate Boundaries

For each boundary in the intent contract:

1. **Read the boundary** from the `## Boundaries` section
2. **Check for violations** in the implementation
3. **Mark status:**
   - `[RESPECTED]` — No violations found
   - `[VIOLATED]` — Implementation crosses the boundary

```markdown
### Boundary Check
- [RESPECTED] Boundary 1: <confirmation>
- [VIOLATED] Boundary 2: <what violated it>
```

### Step 4: Stage 1 Gate

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| All criteria PASS + all boundaries RESPECTED | Proceed to Stage 2 |
| Any criterion FAIL | Report failures. Ask user: fix now or proceed anyway? |
| Any boundary VIOLATED | Report violations. Ask user: fix now or proceed anyway? |

**If user chooses to fix:** Stop review, list specific fixes needed.
**If user chooses to proceed:** Note the overrides and continue to Stage 2.


## Stage 2: Code Quality

Runs stub detection and full code quality review.

### Step 1: Stub Detection

Run 5 checks on all changed files:

```bash
# Get changed files
if git diff --cached --name-only 2>/dev/null | head -1 > /dev/null; then
  changed_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
elif git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD 2>/dev/null | head -1 > /dev/null; then
  changed_files=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD)
else
  changed_files=$(git diff --name-only)
fi

# Filter source files
source_files=$(echo "$changed_files" | grep -E "\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|go|rs|sh)$" || true)

STUB_ISSUES=0

for file in $source_files; do
  [[ -f "$file" ]] || continue

  # Check 1: TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER markers
  todo_count=$(grep -cE "(TODO|FIXME|PLACEHOLDER|XXX)" "$file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  if [[ "$todo_count" -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: $file has $todo_count TODO/FIXME markers"
    STUB_ISSUES=$((STUB_ISSUES + 1))
  fi

  # Check 2: Empty function bodies
  empty_fn=$(grep -cE "function.*\{\s*\}|=>\s*\{\s*\}" "$file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  if [[ "$empty_fn" -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: $file has $empty_fn empty functions"
    STUB_ISSUES=$((STUB_ISSUES + 1))
  fi

  # Check 3: Suspicious null/undefined returns
  null_ret=$(grep -cE "return (null|undefined);" "$file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  if [[ "$null_ret" -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: $file has $null_ret null/undefined returns — verify intentional"
    STUB_ISSUES=$((STUB_ISSUES + 1))
  fi

  # Check 4: Substantive line count
  subst_lines=$(grep -cvE "^\s*(//|/\*|\*|#|import|export|$)" "$file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  if [[ "$subst_lines" -lt 5 ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: $file has only $subst_lines substantive lines"
    STUB_ISSUES=$((STUB_ISSUES + 1))
  fi

  # Check 5: Mock/test data in production code
  mock_count=$(grep -cE "const.*(mock|test|dummy|fake).*=" "$file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  if [[ "$mock_count" -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: $file has $mock_count mock/test data references"
    STUB_ISSUES=$((STUB_ISSUES + 1))
  fi
done

echo "Stub detection complete: $STUB_ISSUES issues found"
```

### Step 2: Multi-LLM Quality Review (RECOMMENDED)

**After stub detection, dispatch code to multiple providers for parallel quality review.** A Claude-only review pipeline misses what external models catch — Codex excels at logic errors and correctness, Gemini excels at security and edge case analysis. Using both produces higher-confidence findings.

**Check provider availability and dispatch in parallel:**

```bash
# Get the diff for review
DIFF_CONTENT=$(git diff --cached 2>/dev/null || git diff HEAD~1..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff)
```

**If external providers are available — dispatch focused reviews through Octopus routing:**
```bash
providers=()
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && providers+=(codex)
command -v agy >/dev/null 2>&1 && providers+=(agy)
command -v gemini >/dev/null 2>&1 && providers+=(gemini)

for provider in "${providers[@]}"; do
  safe_provider=$(printf '%s' "$provider" | tr -c '[:alnum:]_-' '_')
  "${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh" spawn "$provider" \
    "Review this code diff for LOGIC, CORRECTNESS, and SECURITY issues. Focus on:
1. Logic bugs and off-by-one errors
2. Unhandled error paths
3. Race conditions or concurrency issues
4. Incorrect type handling or implicit coercions
5. Security issues at trust boundaries

Report ONLY high-confidence issues. Do NOT flag style preferences.

DIFF:
${DIFF_CONTENT}" > "/tmp/octopus-review-${safe_provider}.md" 2>/dev/null &
done
```

**Wait for external reviews to complete, then synthesize all findings from Claude plus available external providers into a unified quality assessment.** If external providers are unavailable, fall back to the Claude-only review below.

**Claude (you) performs the full quality review regardless:**

1. **Architecture alignment** — Does the code follow project patterns?
2. **Error handling** — Are errors caught and handled appropriately?
3. **Security** — Any OWASP Top 10 issues?
4. **Performance** — Any obvious bottlenecks or N+1 queries?
5. **Readability** — Clear naming, reasonable complexity?
6. **Test coverage** — Are new behaviors tested?

**Synthesize external findings:** If external providers returned results, merge their findings with yours. Where providers disagree on severity, note the divergence. Where multiple providers flag the same issue, mark it as high-confidence.

### Step 3: Present Stage 2 Results

```markdown
## Stage 2: Code Quality

### Stub Detection
- Files scanned: N
- Issues found: N
- [Details of each issue]

### Quality Review
- Architecture: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
- Error Handling: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
- Security: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
- Performance: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
- Readability: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
- Test Coverage: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]

### Blocking Issues
[List any issues that must be fixed before merge]

### Recommendations
[Non-blocking suggestions for improvement]
```


## Combined Report

After both stages complete, present the unified report:

```markdown
## Staged Review — Complete

### Stage 1: Spec Compliance
- Success Criteria: N/N passed
- Boundaries: N/N respected
- Verdict: [PASS/FAIL]

### Stage 2: Code Quality
- Stub Detection: N issues
- Quality Score: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Blocking Issues: N
- Verdict: [PASS/FAIL]

### Overall Verdict: [PASS/FAIL]

[If FAIL: list specific items that must be addressed]
[If PASS: ready for merge/ship]
```


## When to Use Each Review Type

| Review Type | When | What It Checks |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| **skill-code-review** | Quick PR review | Code quality only |
| **skill-staged-review** | Major feature completion | Spec compliance + code quality |
| **skill-verification-gate** | Before any completion claim | Evidence of passing |


## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| No intent contract | Skip Stage 1, warn user, run Stage 2 only |
| No changed files | Report nothing to review |
| Git not available | Use file listing instead of git diff |
| Stage 1 failures | Ask user: fix or override |
| Stage 2 blocking issues | Must fix before merge |


## The Bottom Line

```
Staged Review = Spec Compliance (Stage 1) + Code Quality (Stage 2)
Stage 1 gates Stage 2. Both must pass for overall PASS.
```

**Build the right thing, then build it right.**


## Post Results to PR (v8.44.0)

After the combined report is generated, check for an open PR and post findings.

```bash
# Detect open PR on current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "")
PR_NUM=""

if [[ -n "$CURRENT_BRANCH" && "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" && "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "master" ]]; then
    if command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
        PR_NUM=$(gh pr list --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --json number --jq '.[0].number' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    fi
fi

if [[ -n "$PR_NUM" ]]; then
    # Post combined report as PR comment
    gh pr comment "$PR_NUM" --body "## Staged Review — Claude Octopus

${COMBINED_REPORT}

*Staged review by Claude Octopus (/octo:staged-review)*"

    echo "Staged review posted to PR #${PR_NUM}"
fi
```

**Behavior:**
- Auto-posts when running inside `/octo:deliver` or `/octo:embrace` workflows
- Asks user first when invoked standalone via `/octo:staged-review`
