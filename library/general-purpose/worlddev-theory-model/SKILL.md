# Conceptual & Analytical Framework (worlddev-theory-model)

## When to trigger

- The paper has a "theory" or "conceptual framework" section that is decorative — cited and then never used
- Reviewers say the empirics are fine but the paper "doesn't add up to an argument"
- A formal model is included by reflex, when a clear conceptual framework would serve WD's readers better
- The mechanism connecting cause and outcome is asserted, not theorized
- A qualitative paper's themes are described but not organized by any analytical lens

## What "theory" means at WD

WD is **not** a journal that demands a formal model. For most WD papers, "theory" means a **conceptual or analytical framework drawn from development scholarship** — a structured account of the mechanism that tells the reader what to look for, why the variables matter, and how the pieces connect. A formal model is welcome when it earns its place (it disciplines an argument that prose cannot), but a model bolted on for prestige is a liability: WD's multidisciplinary referees punish "theory theater" — equations that do no work the empirics depend on.

The test of a good WD framework is **load-bearing**: remove it and the paper's interpretation collapses. It should generate the hypotheses (quant) or sensitizing concepts (qual), define the scope conditions, and frame what the findings mean for development.

## Choosing the right framework vehicle

| Vehicle | Use when | WD caution |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Formal model** | A precise mechanism with non-obvious comparative statics the data test | Must connect to estimands; no model for ornament |
| **Conceptual framework** (boxes-and-arrows / theory-of-change) | A multi-step development mechanism (e.g. aid → institutions → service delivery) | Each arrow must be defended and ideally evidenced |
| **Analytical lens** (capabilities, political settlements, institutional bricolage, livelihoods, commons governance) | The contribution reinterprets evidence through a development-theory tradition | Apply the lens; do not just invoke its name |
| **Grounded / inductive** | Qualitative work building concepts from data | Make the build explicit; show how data generated the categories |

Pick **one** primary vehicle. Stacking a formal model, a theory-of-change diagram, and three analytical lenses signals that none is doing the work.

## Making the framework load-bearing — a sequence

1. **State the mechanism in one sentence** before any formalism: "X improves Y because it shifts the bargaining power of Z."
2. **Derive what we should observe** if the mechanism holds — and crucially what we should *not* observe (a discriminating prediction).
3. **Map each prediction to a specific piece of evidence** later in the paper (a coefficient, a case contrast, an interview pattern).
4. **State scope conditions** — where the mechanism should and should not operate. WD readers care intensely about context-dependence; a framework that claims universality is suspect.
5. **Return to the framework in the discussion** — show what the evidence taught you about the theory, not just about the world.

## A worked example (illustrative)

A paper argues microcredit raises women's autonomy. A decorative version cites empowerment theory and runs regressions. A load-bearing WD version specifies the mechanism (credit relaxes a liquidity constraint that previously forced dependence on a spouse), derives a discriminating prediction (effects concentrate where women lacked independent income, not everywhere), maps it to a heterogeneity test, and states the scope condition (no effect where social norms bar women from controlling the loan). Now the theory predicts the pattern of effects, not merely their existence.

## Checklist

- [ ] One primary framework vehicle chosen, fit to the contribution
- [ ] The mechanism is stated in plain language before any formalism
- [ ] The framework generates a discriminating prediction (or sensitizing concepts) used in the empirics
- [ ] Each prediction maps to a specific exhibit, case, or pattern
- [ ] Scope conditions / context-dependence are explicit
- [ ] The discussion revisits the framework in light of the evidence
- [ ] No formal model included purely for prestige; no lens merely name-checked

## Anti-patterns

- "Theory theater": equations or a diagram that the empirical strategy never uses
- Citing a development-theory tradition (capabilities, political settlements) and then ignoring it in analysis
- Asserting the mechanism instead of theorizing it, leaving the reader to infer the logic
- Claiming a universal mechanism with no scope conditions — WD distrusts context-free claims
- A qualitative paper whose themes float free of any analytical organizing principle
