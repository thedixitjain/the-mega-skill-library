## Tasks

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Describe what this phase delivers - "Establishes X capability" or "Enables Y functionality"]

- [ ] **T{{PHASE_NUMBER}}.1 [Primary deliverable name]** `[activity: domain-modeling]`

  1. Prime: Read [entity/component] specification `[ref: solution/Section X; lines: Y-Z]`
  2. Test: [Behavior 1]; [Behavior 2]; [Edge case handling]
  3. Implement: Create `src/[path]/[File].ts` with [key capability]
  4. Validate: Unit tests pass; lint clean; types check
  5. Success: [Criterion 1] `[ref: requirements/AC-X.Y]`; [Criterion 2] `[ref: solution/Section]`

- [ ] **T{{PHASE_NUMBER}}.2 [Secondary deliverable name]** `[activity: data-architecture]`

  1. Prime: Review [pattern/interface] requirements `[ref: solution/Section X]`
  2. Test: [CRUD operations]; [Query patterns]; [Error handling]
  3. Implement: Create `src/[path]/[File].ts` with [key capability]
  4. Validate: Integration tests pass; lint clean; types check
  5. Success: [Criterion 1] `[ref: requirements/AC-X.Y]`; [Criterion 2] `[ref: solution/Section]`

- [ ] **T{{PHASE_NUMBER}}.3 Phase Validation** `[activity: validate]`

  - Run all Phase {{PHASE_NUMBER}} tests. Verify against solution.md patterns and requirements.md acceptance criteria. Lint and typecheck pass.
