# Implementation Plan

## Validation Checklist

### CRITICAL GATES (Must Pass)

- [ ] All `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers have been addressed
- [ ] All specification file paths are correct and exist
- [ ] Each phase follows TDD: Prime → Test → Implement → Validate
- [ ] Every task has verifiable success criteria
- [ ] A developer could follow this plan independently

### QUALITY CHECKS (Should Pass)

- [ ] Context priming section is complete
- [ ] All implementation phases are defined with linked phase files
- [ ] Dependencies between phases are clear (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Parallel work is properly tagged with `[parallel: true]`
- [ ] Activity hints provided for specialist selection `[activity: type]`
- [ ] Every phase references relevant solution.md sections
- [ ] Every test references requirements.md acceptance criteria
- [ ] Integration & E2E tests defined in final phase
- [ ] Project commands match actual project setup

## Specification Compliance Guidelines

### How to Ensure Specification Adherence

1. **Before Each Phase**: Complete the Pre-Implementation Specification Gate
2. **During Implementation**: Reference specific solution.md sections in each task
3. **After Each Task**: Run Specification Compliance checks
4. **Phase Completion**: Verify all specification requirements are met

### Deviation Protocol

When implementation requires changes from the specification:
1. Document the deviation with clear rationale
2. Obtain approval before proceeding
3. Update solution.md when the deviation improves the design
4. Record all deviations in this plan for traceability

## Metadata Reference

- `[parallel: true]` - Tasks that can run concurrently
- `[component: component-name]` - For multi-component features
- `[ref: document/section; lines: 1, 2-3]` - Links to specifications, patterns, or interfaces and (if applicable) line(s)
- `[activity: type]` - Activity hint for specialist agent selection

### Success Criteria

**Validate** = Process verification ("did we follow TDD?")
**Success** = Outcome verification ("does it work correctly?")

```markdown
# Single-line format
- Success: [Criterion] `[ref: requirements/AC-X.Y]`

# Multi-line format
- Success:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1] `[ref: requirements/AC-X.Y]`
  - [ ] [Criterion 2] `[ref: solution/Section]`
```

## Context Priming

*GATE: Read all files in this section before starting any implementation.*

**Specification**:

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Replace with actual paths from your spec directory]
- `.start/specs/[NNN]-[name]/requirements.md` - Product Requirements
- `.start/specs/[NNN]-[name]/solution.md` - Solution Design
- `docs/{patterns,interfaces,research}/[name].md` - Optional references

**Key Design Decisions**:

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Extract 2-5 critical decisions from solution.md that affect implementation]
- **ADR-1**: [Decision name] - [One-line summary of what was decided and why]
- **ADR-2**: [Decision name] - [One-line summary]

**Implementation Context**:

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Update implementation-relevant commands to match project setup]
```bash
# Testing
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests

# Quality
npm run lint                # Linting
npm run typecheck           # Type checking

# Full validation
npm run validate            # All checks
```

## Implementation Phases

Each phase is defined in a separate file. Tasks follow red-green-refactor: **Prime** (understand context), **Test** (red), **Implement** (green), **Validate** (refactor + verify).

> **Tracking Principle**: Track logical units that produce verifiable outcomes. The TDD cycle is the method, not separate tracked items.
