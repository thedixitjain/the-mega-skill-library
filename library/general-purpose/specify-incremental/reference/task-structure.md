# Task Structure Reference

Task granularity principle, TDD phase pattern, and metadata annotations.

## Task Granularity Principle

**Track logical units that produce verifiable outcomes.** The TDD cycle is the execution method, not separate tracked items.

### Good Tracking Units (produces outcome)
- "Payment Entity" — Produces: working entity with tests
- "Stripe Adapter" — Produces: working integration with tests
- "Payment Form Component" — Produces: working UI with tests

### Bad Tracking Units (too granular)
- "Read payment interface contracts" — Preparation, not deliverable
- "Test Payment.validate() rejects negative amounts" — Part of larger outcome
- "Run linting" — Validation step, not deliverable

---

## Task Structure Pattern

```markdown
- [ ] **T1.1 Payment Entity** `[activity: domain-modeling]`

  **Prime**: Read payment interface contracts `[ref: solution/Section 4.2; lines: 145-200]`

  **Test**: Entity validation rejects negative amounts; supports currency conversion; handles refunds

  **Implement**: Create `src/domain/Payment.ts` with validation logic

  **Validate**: Run unit tests, lint, typecheck
```

The checkbox tracks "Payment Entity" as a unit. Prime/Test/Implement/Validate are embedded guidance.

## TDD Phase Structure

Every task follows red-green-refactor within this pattern:

### 1. Prime Context
- Read relevant specification sections
- Understand interfaces and contracts
- Load patterns and examples

### 2. Write Tests (Red)
- Test behavior before implementation
- Reference requirements.md acceptance criteria
- Cover happy path and edge cases

### 3. Implement (Green)
- Build to pass tests
- Follow solution.md architecture
- Use discovered patterns

### 4. Validate (Refactor)
- Run automated tests
- Check code quality (lint, format)
- Verify specification compliance

---

## Task Metadata

Use these annotations in the plan:

```markdown
- [ ] T1.2.1 [Task description] `[ref: solution/Section 5; lines: 100-150]` `[activity: backend-api]`
```

| Metadata | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[parallel: true]` | Tasks that can run concurrently |
| `[component: name]` | For multi-component features |
| `[ref: doc/section; lines: X-Y]` | Links to specifications |
| `[activity: type]` | Hint for specialist selection |

---

## Specification Compliance

Every phase should include a validation task:

```markdown
- [ ] **T1.3 Phase Validation** `[activity: validate]`

  Run all phase tests, linting, type checking. Verify against solution.md patterns and requirements.md acceptance criteria.
```

For complex phases, validation is embedded in each task's **Validate** step.

### Deviation Protocol

When implementation requires changes from the specification:
1. Document the deviation with clear rationale
2. Obtain approval before proceeding
3. Update solution.md when the deviation improves the design
4. Record all deviations in the relevant phase file for traceability
