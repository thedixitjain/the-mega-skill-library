> **Host: Codex CLI** — This skill was designed for Claude Code and adapted for Codex.
> Cross-reference commands use installed skill names in Codex rather than `/octo:*` slash commands.
> Use the active Codex shell and subagent tools. Do not claim a provider, model, or host subagent is available until the current session exposes it.

# Intent Contract System

## Purpose

The intent contract creates a **persistent record of user intent** that:
- Captures what the user is trying to accomplish
- Defines success criteria upfront
- Establishes boundaries and constraints
- Travels through the entire workflow
- Validates final outputs against original intent

This closes the loop between intention and delivery.


## Intent Contract Structure

The intent contract is stored in `.claude/session-intent.md` and follows this format:

```markdown
# Intent Contract

**Created**: [ISO timestamp]
**Workflow**: [discover/embrace/review/etc.]
**Status**: [active/validating/completed]

## Job Statement
What the user is trying to accomplish (JTBD framework).

[User's goal in plain language]

## Success Criteria

### Good Enough
- [Minimum viable success criterion 1]
- [Minimum viable success criterion 2]

### Exceptional
- [Excellence criterion 1]
- [Excellence criterion 2]

## Boundaries
What this should NOT be:
- [Boundary 1: What to avoid]
- [Boundary 2: What's out of scope]

## Context & Constraints

**Stakeholders**: [Who needs this to work for them]
**Existing Assets**: [What to build on]
**Timeline**: [Time constraints if any]
**Technical Constraints**: [Platform, language, dependencies]

## Clarifying Context
[Any answers from the 3-question pattern]

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Meets "good enough" criteria
- [ ] Respects all boundaries
- [ ] Works for all stakeholders
- [ ] Builds on existing assets appropriately
```


## Implementation Instructions

### When to Create Intent Contract

Create an intent contract when:
- User invokes a major workflow (`/octo:embrace`, `/octo:discover`, `/octo:plan`)
- User explicitly asks to "plan" or "set goals" for a task
- A workflow requires multiple phases and validation

**Do NOT create for:**
- Quick, single-action commands
- Simple file reads or searches
- Conversational questions

### Step 1: Capture Intent

After asking the 3 clarifying questions in a workflow, prompt the user to define:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What are you ultimately trying to accomplish?",
      header: "Goal",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Let me describe it", description: "I'll write my own goal statement"},
        {label: "Make a decision", description: "Choose between options"},
        {label: "Create deliverable", description: "Build something specific"},
        {label: "Understand a problem", description: "Research and learn"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What defines success for this?",
      header: "Success",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {label: "Clear recommendation", description: "Know what to do next"},
        {label: "Working implementation", description: "Code that functions"},
        {label: "Team alignment", description: "Everyone understands"},
        {label: "Problem solved", description: "Issue is resolved"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What should this NOT be or do?",
      header: "Boundaries",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {label: "Over-engineered", description: "Keep it simple"},
        {label: "Incomplete", description: "Must be production-ready"},
        {label: "Disconnected", description: "Must fit our architecture"},
        {label: "Risky", description: "Avoid experimental approaches"}
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

If user selects "Let me describe it", follow up with a text prompt for their custom goal.

### Step 2: Write Intent Contract File

Use the Write tool to create `.claude/session-intent.md`:

```bash
cat > .claude/session-intent.md <<EOF
# Intent Contract

**Created**: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
**Workflow**: ${WORKFLOW_NAME}
**Status**: active

## Job Statement
${USER_GOAL}

## Success Criteria

### Good Enough
${MIN_SUCCESS_CRITERIA}

### Exceptional
${EXCEPTIONAL_CRITERIA}

## Boundaries
What this should NOT be:
${BOUNDARIES}

## Context & Constraints

**Stakeholders**: ${STAKEHOLDERS}
**Timeline**: ${TIMELINE}

## Clarifying Context
${THREE_QUESTION_ANSWERS}

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Meets "good enough" criteria
- [ ] Respects all boundaries
- [ ] Works for all stakeholders
EOF
```

### Step 3: Reference During Execution

Throughout the workflow, periodically read `.claude/session-intent.md` to:
- Stay aligned with user goals
- Make decisions consistent with boundaries
- Keep stakeholders in mind

At key decision points, explicitly say:
```
Checking against intent contract: [reference specific criterion]
```

### Step 4: Validate at End

When the workflow completes, read `.claude/session-intent.md` and validate:

**Validation Process:**

1. **Read the intent contract**
2. **Check each success criterion:**
   - ✓ Met - explain how
   - ✗ Not met - explain why and what's needed
   - ~ Partially met - explain gaps

3. **Check boundaries:**
   - ✓ Respected - confirm
   - ✗ Violated - explain what happened

4. **Generate validation report:**

```markdown
# Validation Report

## Success Criteria Check

### Good Enough Criteria
- [✓] Criterion 1: [How it was met]
- [✗] Criterion 2: [Why not met, what's needed]

### Exceptional Criteria
- [~] Criterion 1: [Partial progress explanation]

## Boundary Check
All boundaries respected: [Yes/No]
- Boundary 1: [✓/✗] [Explanation]

## Gaps & Next Steps
[If any criteria not met, list concrete next steps]

## Overall Assessment
[Summary: Does this fulfill the original intent?]
```

5. **Present to user:**
   - Show the validation report
   - Ask if they want to address any gaps
   - Update intent contract status to "completed" or "validating"

### Step 5: Update Intent Contract Status

Update the `Status` field in `.claude/session-intent.md`:
- `active` → workflow in progress
- `validating` → checking against criteria
- `completed` → all criteria met, boundaries respected
- `incomplete` → some criteria not met, gaps identified

6. DELIVER phase (reference intent)
7. Validate against intent contract
8. Present validation report
```

### Discover Workflow

### Plan Workflow (Future)

```
1. Capture comprehensive intent
2. Create intent contract
3. Route to appropriate workflows
4. Execute custom sequence
5. Validate against intent contract
6. Present validation report
```
