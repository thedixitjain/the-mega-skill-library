# SolidWorks Learner

Track the session from the first SolidWorks message. When invoked, reread the
entire Codex task and rebuild the complete current payload, not a delta. Keep
only corrected final versions.

Never show the raw payload, base64 images, or full submission JSON to the user.

## 1. Confirm relevance and session

If no SolidWorks modeling, API calls, CAD code, design decisions, or debugging
occurred, return an internal skip result and stop.

Read `.sw-learner-state.json` in the CAD working directory and require a
non-empty fixed `sessionId`. If it is missing, resolve the plugin root and run
`scripts/sw_session.py start` once, then keep that UUID for the rest of the
task.

## 2. Resolve the part

Use quoted `curl` and the configured `SW_KB_HOST` default to query:

```text
GET /api/parts?q={encoded-part-identifier}&pageSize=20
```

Record the best exact or close `partId`; use `null` when none exists. Preserve
the known `partNumber`.

## 3. Collect eligible images

Find images referenced by generated code (`SaveBMP`, `ExportBMP`, `SaveAs`, or
paths ending in `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.tif`, `.gif`) and
images actually shown in the task. Include only existing readable files under
10 MB. Deduplicate by filename and encode bytes as base64.

Use MIME types `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/bmp`, `image/tiff`, or
`image/gif`. Convert Windows paths to accessible host paths when working through
WSL.

## 4. Build FeedbackSubmission

Follow `../../schemas/feedback-submission.schema.json`. Always include:

- `issues`: a two-to-five sentence narrative of what was built, the approach,
  mistakes fixed, validation, and final state;
- `sessionId`: the fixed ID for this Codex task;
- `partId`: the matched UUID or `null` when useful.

Add arrays only when they contain at least one item. Omit empty arrays entirely.

### Instructions

Include exact ordered build steps with the SolidWorks version, material, final
feature order, real parameter values, API calls, validation, and exports. Skip
generic steps that add no reusable knowledge.

### Macros

Include every code artifact written in the task: Python, VBA, or SWAPI. Store
the full verbatim final working source, never a summary or truncated excerpt.
Required macro fields are `name`, `language`, and `code`. Add description,
`swFeaturesUsed`, parameters, template flag, version, and part ID when known.

### Known errors

Include only concrete failures with the exact return value or error, affected
SolidWorks method, and a resolution that actually worked. Exclude typos,
immediately-fixed syntax mistakes, vague symptoms, and non-SolidWorks issues.

Use severity `critical` for total failure, `high` for plausible but wrong
output, `medium` for a caught and repaired failure, and `low` for minor
inconvenience.

### Lessons

Include non-obvious lessons demonstrated in this task, from successes and
failures. Every lesson needs `category`, `title`, `whatHappened`, `rootCause`,
`prevention`, and `severity`. Make `prevention` a concrete rule, never merely
`be careful`.

## 5. Validate and persist privately

Write the payload to `.sw-feedback-payload.json` in the CAD working directory
only when persistence is needed across the consent turn. Ensure it is ignored
by version control. Validate it with:

```text
python <plugin-root>/scripts/validate_feedback.py .sw-feedback-payload.json
python <plugin-root>/scripts/sw_session.py mark-payload --part-id <uuid-or-null> --part-number <value>
```

Increment `payloadVersion` on every rebuild. Replace earlier payload content;
do not accumulate stale or broken code versions.
