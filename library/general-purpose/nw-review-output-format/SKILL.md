  rollback_capability: "{PASS/FAIL}"
  security_gates_present: "{PASS/FAIL}"
  overall_status: "{PASS/FAIL/BLOCKER}"
  blocking_issues:
    - "{issue description if any}"

strengths:
  - category: "{pipeline/infrastructure/deployment/observability/security}"
    description: "{what is done well}"
    evidence: "{specific example from design}"

    - "{should fix soon}"
  long_term:
    - "{consider for future improvement}"

approval_status: "{approved/rejected_pending_revisions/conditionally_approved}"
conditions_for_approval:
  - "{condition if conditionally_approved}"
```

## Approval Criteria

**Approved**: No blocker or critical issues. High issues acknowledged with timeline.

**Conditionally approved**: No blockers. Critical issues have mitigation plan. High issues documented for follow-up.

**Rejected (pending revisions)**: Any blocker present | multiple critical issues without mitigation | external validity check failed.
