# R&R Rebuttal (msom-rebuttal)

## When to trigger

- You received an M&SOM major/minor revision and must plan the response
- Referees ask for additional numerical studies, robustness, or identification work
- The DE/AE flag operations centrality, tractability, or managerial relevance
- You are drafting the point-by-point response letter

## Revise first, then write the letter

Plan from the **Department Editor and Associate Editor** signals first — in M&SOM's department-routed model, their priorities are the binding contract; referee points must each be **addressed or carefully rebutted**. Do the actual modeling/analysis work before writing prose: add the proposition, run the requested numerical study, strengthen the identification. Then write a response that maps each comment to a concrete change.

## Common M&SOM revision demands

- **Analytical:** generalize or relax a binding assumption and show the policy structure survives (or characterize when it does not); add comparative statics; expand the **numerical study** to quantify magnitudes versus benchmarks and stress assumptions; move heavy proofs to the **≤16-page supplement**.
- **Empirical:** shore up identification (additional instruments, event-study/parallel-trends evidence, placebo/falsification tests), treat endogenous operational decisions, and report effects in operational magnitudes.
- **Both:** sharpen the **managerial implication** and confirm the operations decision is still central; keep the structured abstract aligned with the revised results.

## Watch the constraints while revising

The added results must fit the **32-page typeset cap** (everything counts) — push new proofs and experiments into the **online supplement (≤ 16 pages)**. Keep the manuscript anonymized (double-anonymous), keep INFORMS author-year style, and update the structured abstract if results changed.

## The response letter

- Open with a brief summary of the major changes and how the operations contribution is now sharper.
- Restate each DE/AE/referee comment verbatim, then your response and the **exact location** of the change (section, proposition, table, supplement page).
- Where you disagree, rebut respectfully with evidence; do not silently ignore a point.
- Be consistent: the letter, the manuscript, and the abstract must tell the same story.

## Checklist

- [ ] DE/AE priorities identified and treated as binding
- [ ] Every referee comment mapped to a change or a reasoned rebuttal
- [ ] Requested proofs/numerical studies/identification work actually done
- [ ] Operations centrality and managerial implication reaffirmed
- [ ] Added material fits the 32-page cap; overflow moved to the ≤16-page supplement
- [ ] Structured abstract and anonymization updated; INFORMS style intact
- [ ] Point-by-point letter cites exact locations of each change

## Anti-patterns

- Writing the response letter before doing the modeling/analysis work.
- Treating referee and DE/AE comments as equal when DE/AE priorities should lead.
- Adding results that blow past the 32-page cap instead of using the supplement.
- Quietly dropping a comment you find inconvenient.
- Letting the revision dilute the operations decision at the core.

## Triaging the decision letter (priority before prose)

In M&SOM's department-routed model the comments are not equal in weight. The DE's and AE's items are binding — they gate acceptance — so address them fully and rebut only with strong evidence; substantive referee points are mapped to comment → change → exact location, and conflicts go to the AE rather than being silently resolved. The fatal error is spending the revision on referee minutiae while under-serving the DE/AE priority.

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

Vignette: an R&R on a supply-chain contracting model where the AE writes "the coordination result is elegant but I do not see the managerial insight" and a referee asks for a more general demand distribution. The disciplined response treats the AE's insight gap as the binding item — adding the comparative static that the optimal buyback rate *falls as demand becomes more variable* and leading with that rule — then does the referee's generalization, showing the structure survives under an illustrative broader class, and pushes the extended proof to the supplement. The letter maps each point to a section and proposition number.

## Referee-pushback patterns and the venue fix

- *"Structural result still lacks a managerial takeaway."* → Add the named decision rule and its comparative static; revise the structured abstract's managerial-implications part to match.
- *"New robustness blew past the page cap."* → Move proofs and extra experiments to the supplement; confirm the current cap against the journal's author guidelines. And never quietly drop an inconvenient comment — restate it verbatim, then respond, since silence reads as evasion.

## Output format

```
【DE/AE priorities】binding items ...
【Per-referee plan】comment → change / rebuttal → location ...
【Work done】proofs / numerical study / identification ...
【Constraints】within 32 pages; overflow to supplement; abstract updated ...
【Response letter】point-by-point with exact locations ...
【Next step】resubmit via ScholarOne → msom-review-process
```
