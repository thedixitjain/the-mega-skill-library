<objective>
Capture an idea that's too big for now but should surface automatically when the right
milestone arrives. Seeds solve context rot: instead of a one-liner in Deferred that nobody
reads, a seed preserves the full WHY, WHEN to surface, and breadcrumbs to details.

Creates: .planning/seeds/SEED-NNN-slug.md
Consumed by: /gsd:new-milestone (scans seeds and presents matches)
