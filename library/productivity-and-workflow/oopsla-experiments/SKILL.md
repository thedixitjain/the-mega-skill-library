# OOPSLA Experiments

OOPSLA's evaluation question is not "is there a big table?" but "does the
evidence *type* match the claim *type*?" The venue's published scope runs
from mathematical formalisms to empirical studies, and its exemplars span
benchmark suites, measurement methodology, corpus mining, and language
experience reports (`resources/exemplars/library.md`) — so the first design
act is choosing the right instrument, and the second is executing it to the
SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines standard that reviewers apply
checklist-in-hand (`oopsla-reproducibility` operationalizes the pillars).

## Claim-type → evidence-type routing

| Claim type | Primary evidence | Common OOPSLA failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Faster / cheaper" | Benchmarks vs strongest baseline, variance reported | Weak baseline; startup vs steady-state conflated |
| "More expressive / safer" | Formal result + programs witnessing the boundary | Expressiveness asserted by example only |
| "Programmers benefit" | User study or field data with a design | Anecdote from the authors' own use |
| "Occurs in practice" | Corpus study with stated selection rule | Convenience sample of famous repos |
| "The design generalizes" | Second instantiation (language/runtime/domain) | Single-host generalization claims |
| "Semantics is right" | Mechanization or proofs + conformance tests | Calculus untethered from the implementation |

A paper may need two rows; it rarely supports five. Cutting a claim is
cheaper than defending its missing evidence through a Major Revision.

## Baselines and workloads that survive scrutiny

- The baseline is what a skeptical expert would actually use today, tuned the
  way its own paper tunes it — document versions and flags in the paper.
- Workload selection needs a *rule* (suite version, corpus filter, sampling
  frame) stated before results; exclusions listed with reasons. Curated-only
  workload sets are the most quietly fatal reviewer finding.
- For LLM-era tooling claims, hold out for contamination: date-split corpora,
  and report sensitivity to prompt/configuration where relevant.
- Negative controls: include a configuration where your mechanism should
  *not* help and show that it doesn't. Nothing signals honesty faster.

## Sizing experiments to the round calendar

The two-round system changes experimental economics. Between an R1 verdict
and the R2 resubmission there are only months, so:

```text
Design now, before Round N:
  - matrix of runs a reviewer could plausibly demand (extra baseline,
    larger corpus, second platform) with wall-clock + hardware cost each
  - keep the harness parameterized so a demanded cell is a config change
  - archive raw results per run (the ledger of oopsla-reproducibility)
Payoff: a Minor Revision executes in days; a Major Revision's
expectation list maps to known cells instead of new engineering.
```

## Analysis floor

- Repetition counts, warmup handling, and dispersion (CI or IQR) for every
  performance number; significance or effect size where comparisons are the
  claim.
- Summaries chosen deliberately (geomean for ratios) and stated.
- Human-subject work: sample size rationale, task design, and ethics/IRB
  status — the venue takes the human-aspects lane seriously enough to review
  it by social-science norms.
- Case studies report failures encountered, not only successes; an
  experience report with zero friction reads as marketing
  (`oopsla-writing-style`).

## Output format

```text
[Routing] claim → evidence rows used + mismatches found
[Baseline audit] strongest-sensible test: pass / gaps
[Workload rule] stated / absent; exclusions justified: yes/no
[Demand matrix] anticipated reviewer demands with cost estimates
[Analysis floor] repetitions/dispersion/summary-statistic compliance
```
