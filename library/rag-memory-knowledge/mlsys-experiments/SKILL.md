# MLSys Experiments

Use this before the evaluation is frozen. An MLSys evaluation exists to answer one
compound question: *does the named mechanism deliver the claimed system-level payoff on
workloads that matter, at acceptable cost, for understood reasons?* Each clause needs its
own evidence, and this venue — which published the MLPerf Training methodology in its own
proceedings — holds measurement to benchmark-committee standards.

## Workload selection: the make-or-break choice

"Unrepresentative workload" is the modal fatal objection at this venue. Defend the
choice explicitly:

- Anchor on recognizable workloads: MLPerf-family tasks, widely used open models, or
  published request traces. Bespoke workloads need a characterization section showing
  their statistics (request rates, sequence lengths, arrival burstiness, model mix).
- Cover the axis your mechanism exploits: a scheduler for bursty load must be tested on
  bursty *and* uniform load; the uniform case bounds your claim, it does not weaken it.
- Include at least one workload where you expect little or no gain, and show it. A
  non-win row is the cheapest credibility purchase available.
- State workload licensing/provenance — traces you cannot release constrain your future
  artifact badges (see `mlsys-artifact-evaluation`).

## Baseline discipline

- Compare against the current strongest systems, version-pinned, in their recommended
  configurations — and tune them with the **same budget** you gave your own system.
  Document both budgets; asymmetric tuning is treated as invalidating.
- Include the "do nothing" configuration where meaningful (e.g., default framework
  behavior); reviewers use it to sanity-check absolute numbers.
- If a relevant baseline cannot run in your setting, demonstrate the incompatibility
  rather than asserting it.

## The reporting quartet

Never report throughput alone. Each headline claim carries four coordinates:

| Coordinate | Report as | Classic gaming pattern it prevents |
|---|---|---|
| Throughput/goodput | Under a stated latency constraint | Batch-size inflation that destroys tails |
| Latency | p50 and p99 (p99.9 for serving), distributions not means | Mean-only tables hiding stragglers |
| Memory | Peak device + host, at the measured configuration | Wins that only fit on 80GB parts, unstated |
| Cost/efficiency | $ or joules per unit work, with price/meter basis | "Faster" systems that are 4x more expensive |

Quality (accuracy/perplexity or task metric) rides along whenever the technique could
plausibly change model output — quantization, sparsity, scheduling with dropping,
approximation of any kind. "No quality change" is a claim requiring a measurement.

## Ablation = attribution

Systems papers stack techniques; reviews ask which component pays.

- One ablation row per named mechanism, cumulative or leave-one-out — pick one scheme
  and say which.
- Ablate the *insight*, not only the code: if the claim is "lookahead scheduling wins,"
  include the no-lookahead scheduler, not just the whole-system-off row.
- Sensitivity sweeps over the parameters a deployer must set (window sizes, thresholds);
  a mechanism needing per-workload hand-tuning must say so.

## Scaling and sensitivity evidence

```yaml
# experiment-matrix.yaml — one row per plotted point, generated, never hand-edited
sweep:
  models:    [llama-class-8b, llama-class-70b, moe-16e]
  hardware:  [1xA100, 8xA100-nvlink]        # state interconnect explicitly
  load:      [uniform-qps, bursty-trace-A]
  precision: [bf16, int4]
  trials: 5
  warmup_steps: 20
  metrics: [goodput@p99<250ms, p50, p99, peak_mem_gb, gpu_hours, quality]
  seeds: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

- Plot trends, not points: gain versus model size, versus load, versus GPU count. A
  single-configuration win invites the "will this survive scale?" objection you cannot
  answer in the four-day response window.
- Log everything; regenerate every figure from logs by script (measurement mechanics
  and variance rules live in `mlsys-reproducibility`).

## Statistical floor for systems numbers

Systems papers rarely need hypothesis-testing machinery, but they always need variance
honesty; the floor this venue's reviewers apply:

- Five or more trials for any number in a comparison table; report spread (stdev or
  IQR) and say which in the caption.
- Overlapping spreads mean the difference is not a finding — either run more trials or
  report the tie honestly; a "win" inside noise is worse than a reported tie because
  one reviewer rerun destroys it.
- For latency distributions, trials are not enough: within-run percentiles need enough
  requests that p99 is estimated from hundreds of samples, not three.
- Seed variation matters only where model quality enters the claim; systems noise
  (placement, thermal state, co-tenants) dominates latency variance and is controlled
  by measurement design, not seeds — the split is detailed in `mlsys-reproducibility`.

## Evaluation-design review before running

Run this table exercise before burning GPU-hours: for each claim in the abstract, write
the figure that will support it, the workload it needs, and the strongest objection a
systems reviewer could raise — then check the matrix covers that objection. Claims
without a planned figure get cut from the abstract, not padded later.

## Common reject patterns to design against

- Microbenchmark gains that never appear end-to-end; always include the end-to-end run.
- Gains measured only at one scale/hardware and claimed generally.
- Quality silently degraded by the optimization, discovered by a reviewer from your own
  appendix table.
- Cost omitted where the honest accounting would erase the win.

## Output format

```text
[Evaluation readiness] strong / adequate / weak
[Workload defense] <named anchors + characterization + non-win case present?>
[Baseline symmetry] <versions pinned, tuning budgets equal + documented?>
[Quartet coverage] <throughput/latency-tails/memory/cost per headline claim>
[Attribution] <mechanism -> ablation row>
[Decision-critical missing run] <one experiment>
```
