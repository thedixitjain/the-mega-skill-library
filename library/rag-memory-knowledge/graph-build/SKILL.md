# Build Code Knowledge Graph

Build or update the `.gauntlet/graph.db` knowledge graph
for the current codebase.

## Steps

1. **Detect target**: Use the current working directory
   or a user-specified path.

2. **Check for existing graph**: If `.gauntlet/graph.db`
   exists, run an incremental update. Otherwise, run a
   full build.

3. **Run the build script**:

   For full build:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/graph_build.py <dir>
   ```

   For incremental update:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/graph_build.py <dir> --incremental
   ```

4. **Report results**: Show the JSON output including
   files parsed, nodes created, edges created, and
   duration.

5. **Suggest next steps**: Recommend searching the graph
   or running blast radius analysis.

## When To Use

- At the start of a session to build structural awareness
- After significant code changes to update the graph
- Before running blast radius analysis or flow tracing
- When the user asks about codebase structure

## When NOT To Use

- Querying a graph that already exists (use `gauntlet:graph-search`)
- Building the challenge knowledge base (use `gauntlet:extract`)

## What Gets Parsed

The graph extracts nodes (File, Class, Function, Type,
Test) and edges (CALLS, IMPORTS_FROM, INHERITS, CONTAINS,
IMPLEMENTS, TESTED_BY) from 20+ languages including
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++,
Ruby, and PHP.

## Storage

- Database: `.gauntlet/graph.db` (SQLite with WAL mode)
- Auto-creates `.gauntlet/.gitignore` to prevent commits
- Incremental updates use SHA-256 hashing to skip
  unchanged files

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] `.gauntlet/graph.db` exists and is a valid SQLite file after
  the skill completes; `.gauntlet/.gitignore` exists to prevent
  the database from being committed
- [ ] Build report JSON includes all four keys: `files_parsed`,
  `nodes_created`, `edges_created`, `duration`; values are
  non-zero for non-empty codebases
- [ ] Incremental update path used when `.gauntlet/graph.db` already
  exists (script invoked with `--incremental`); full build only
  on first run
- [ ] Next-step suggestions presented to the user: search the graph
  or run blast-radius analysis
