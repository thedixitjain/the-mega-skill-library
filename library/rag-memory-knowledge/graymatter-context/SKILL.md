# GrayMatter Context

Compile the smallest useful authorized context for the current task instead of loading broad memory exhaust.

## Workflow

1. State the current task clearly and call `context_compile` with a realistic token budget.
2. Prefer the compiled ContextPage summary, selected items, hydration pointers, policy result, and receipt reference over raw memory dumps.
3. Respect retrieval policy. If the compiled result indicates low confidence, stale context, partial coverage, conflict, retry, clarification, or denial, follow that action before answering confidently.
4. Call `procedure_search` when a repeatable methodology may already exist. Use an authorized high-confidence procedure when it fits the task; do not invent tenant filters.
5. Call `retrieval_receipt_get` when the user asks why context was selected, which sources contributed, or how confidence, freshness, coverage, and policy were evaluated.
6. Cite the receipt ID in the response when provenance or selection rationale materially matters.

## Context discipline

- Keep temporary conversational context in the conversation. Save only durable information through the GrayMatter memory skill.
- Do not request or pass tenant, organization, owner, user, role, permission, or ACL identifiers.
- Do not hydrate every pointer by default. Retrieve more detail only when the current task requires it.
- Treat authorization failures as final for that identifier and do not probe for cross-tenant alternatives.
