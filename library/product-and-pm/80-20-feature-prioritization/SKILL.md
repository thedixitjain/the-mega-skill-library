# 80/20 in feature prioritization

The most direct application of the 80/20 rule: deciding which features to invest in. Most products accumulate features over time; many of those features see little use. The discipline is identifying the critical fraction worth deepening and the long tail worth either tucking or removing.

## The prioritization framework

For each feature (proposed or existing), gather:

### 1. Usage signal

If the feature exists: how many users engage with it? How often? Is engagement growing or declining?

If the feature is proposed: how many users say they want it? Is that signal coming from a vocal minority or a representative sample?

### 2. Value signal

When the feature is used, how much value does it produce? A rarely-used feature that produces enormous value when used (year-end tax export) may be more important than a frequently-used one that produces marginal value (a counter widget).

### 3. Effort signal

What does it cost to build, maintain, support, and document?

### 4. Strategic signal

Does the feature reinforce a competitive position, retain a key customer segment, or enable future capabilities?

The 80/20 cut isn't pure usage — it weights usage by value. A rarely-used essential feature stays in the critical fraction. A frequently-used decorative one might not.

## Decision matrix

A simple 2×2 to organize:

```
                    Low value          High value
                    ───────────         ──────────
Low effort     │  Cleanup later   │   Ship now
High effort    │  Don't build     │   Major investment
```

The tricky cases are the diagonals: low-effort + low-value tasks accumulate as "death by a thousand cuts" if not pruned; high-effort + high-value tasks need ruthless scoping or they slip schedule.

## Roadmap shaping

The 80/20 view of a roadmap:

- **The critical 20%** of planned work should account for ~80% of expected user impact. If the planned work is spread evenly across many small features, you're probably underweighting the few that matter most.
- **The trailing 80%** of planned work should be either skipped or radically scoped down.

A useful exercise: take a quarterly roadmap. For each item, estimate user impact and engineering effort. Sort by impact-per-effort. Cut the bottom half. The team's quarter is suddenly half the size with most of the impact preserved.

## When the 80/20 cut hurts

- **Power-user retention.** A feature only 5% of users touch may be the reason that 5% (often the highest-paying segment) chose your product.
- **Compliance and accessibility.** Required by law or ethics; can't be dropped.
- **Foundational capability.** A feature whose value is in *enabling* other features. Search isn't valuable in itself; it's valuable because it makes everything findable.
- **Trust signals.** Audit logs, exportable data, account deletion. Rarely used directly but their presence reassures prospects.

These deserve a different evaluation than pure-usage 80/20 would suggest.

## Roadmap anti-patterns

- **The feature factory.** Every quarter ships 10 features. Most are small. None move metrics. Time fragments across all of them.
- **The pet feature.** A senior leader's favorite that doesn't show up in user research but ships every quarter.
- **The "and one more thing."** A small tweak added to a major feature that doubles its scope.
- **The unfinished long tail.** Features shipped but never polished, growing into a maintenance burden.
- **The roadmap by request.** Building features customers asked for without checking whether they reflect underlying needs (often the underlying need is met by a different feature you already have).

## Worked example: pruning a settings page

A SaaS product's settings page has 38 controls. Usage analytics:

- 7 controls used by ≥50% of users monthly.
- 14 used by 10–50%.
- 17 used by <10%.

Of the trailing 17:
- 5 are needed for compliance (audit log, data export, account deletion). Keep.
- 4 are integrations with services the product team is winding down. Remove from settings; deprecate.
- 8 are legacy options most users have never touched. Move to "Advanced" disclosure; review for removal in a future cycle.

Result: settings page now shows ~7+5 (12 controls) primary; 14 secondary; rest tucked. Maintenance burden drops; common use is faster.

## Heuristics

1. **The "what does the data say?" check.** Usage analytics before opinion. If the data isn't available, instrument first; decide later.
2. **The "who would scream?" test.** For features in the trailing 80%, ask. Each scream is a candidate to retain (or relocate); silence is permission to cut.
3. **The "would we build this today?" test.** For each existing feature, imagine you were starting fresh. Would you build it? If no, it's a candidate for deprecation.
4. **The retention attribution.** Pair feature usage with retention/expansion data. Features used by retained users may be more valuable than raw usage suggests.
