# Roadmap Design

## Roadmap Principles

When this skill is loaded, these principles activate in addition to the agent's core principles:

1. **Measure before planning**: Never create roadmap without quantitative baseline. Require timing breakdowns|impact rankings|target validation. Halt and request data when missing.
2. **Concise roadmaps**: Step descriptions max 50 words, AC max 5 per step at max 30 words each. Bullets over prose. Assume expertise. Eliminate qualifiers/motivational text. Token efficiency compounds -- crafter reads roadmap ~35 times.
3. **Paradigm-aware roadmap strategy**: When functional paradigm selected, adapt roadmap for FP: types-first (algebraic data types before implementation)|composition pipelines|pure core/effect shell|effect boundaries instead of port interfaces. Strategic guidance only -- no code snippets/function signatures.

## Roadmap Critical Rules

1. Never include implementation code in roadmaps. You design; software-crafter writes code.
2. Never create roadmaps without quantitative data. Halt and request measurement data when missing.
3. Roadmap steps with identical patterns (differing by substitution variable) must batch into single step. 3+ identical-pattern steps = batching opportunity.

## Quality Gate (DELIVER only)

- [ ] Roadmap step count efficient (steps/production-files <= 2.5)

## Canonical Format

Use ONLY compact nested format. See `nWave/templates/roadmap-schema.json` for fields/validation. Structure: `roadmap` metadata, `phases` with nested `steps`, `implementation_scope`, `validation`. Phase IDs: two digits (`"01"`). Step IDs: `"NN-MM"`.

## Concision Requirements

Token efficiency: crafter reads roadmap ~35 times (7 phases x 5 steps). 5000-token x 35 = 175k tokens. 1000-token x 35 = 35k (80% savings).

### Quantitative Limits
- Step description: max 50 words | AC per step: max 5 | Each AC: max 30 words
- Step notes: max 100 words
- Target: small (1-3 steps) = 500, medium (4-8) = 1500, large (9-15) = 3000 tokens

### Include
WHAT to build (one sentence) | WHY (brief business value) | Observable outcomes (testable AC) | Architectural constraints | Integration points

### Exclude
HOW to implement | code snippets/class names | algorithm descriptions | step-by-step instructions | tech tutorials | testing strategy (TDD standard) | motivational language | redundancy | examples when description clear

### Compression Techniques
Bullets over prose | eliminate qualifiers | assume expertise | active voice | omit obvious

## Acceptance Criteria Abstraction

AC describe observable outcomes, never internal implementation.

### Rules
Describe WHAT (behavior) not HOW (implementation) | Never reference private methods (underscore prefix) | Never reference internal class decomposition | Never prescribe signatures/params/return types | Crafter decides structure during GREEN + REFACTOR

### Good AC Examples
- "DES module importable from installation target after install"
- "DES utility scripts present and executable in scripts directory"
- "Installation uses backup before overwriting existing components"

### Bad AC Examples (implementation-coupled)
- "_install_des_module() copies src/des/ to ~/.claude/lib/python/des/"
- "verify() checks DES module importable via subprocess test"
- "context.installation_verifier._check_agents() called for verification"

## Step Decomposition Efficiency

### Step Ratio Check
Rule: `steps_count / estimated_production_files <= 2.5`
Violation = over-decomposition. Action: merge steps targeting same file.

### Identical Pattern Detection
Rule: if N steps differ only by substitution variable, batch into 1 step. Threshold: 3+ identical-pattern steps must batch.
Bad: 4 separate steps for AgentsPlugin, CommandsPlugin, TemplatesPlugin, UtilitiesPlugin
Good: 1 step creating all 4

### No-Op Prevention
Each step must add production code. Validation-only steps are not steps.
Bad: "Step 02-05: Validate extraction with integration tests"
Good: validation is part of preceding step's REVIEW phase

## Step-to-Scenario Mapping

For roadmaps feeding DELIVER wave:
1. Read acceptance tests (tests/acceptance/test_*.py) before creating roadmap
2. Count scenarios (def test_*) | 3. ~1 step per scenario (flexibility for infra steps)
4. Mark infra steps: "type: infrastructure" | 5. Principle: 1 Scenario = 1 Step = 1 TDD Cycle

For each step mapped to a distilled acceptance scenario, populate:
- `test_file`: relative path to the test file (e.g., `tests/acceptance/test_auth.py`)
- `scenario_name`: the scenario/test function name (e.g., `test_login_with_valid_credentials`)

These fields enable the crafter to locate and unskip the exact pre-existing test during RED (3-phase canon per ADR-025; legacy logs record the same activation under the RED_ACCEPTANCE sub-step).
If DISTILL was skipped, leave these fields empty — the crafter will write new tests.

## Measure Before Plan Gate

Before any roadmap, verify: 1. Timing data shows WHERE time spent | 2. Impact ranking shows MOST contributing component | 3. Target validation provides evidence

Missing data: halt, request measurement, offer to help. Gate is blocking.

## Simplest Solution Gate

Before multi-phase (>3 steps), document rejected alternatives:

### Alternatives to Consider
1. Configuration-only (no code) | 2. Single-file change | 3. Existing tool/library | 4. Partial (solve 80% simply)

### Documentation Format
```markdown
## Rejected Simple Alternatives

### Alternative 1: {simplest approach}
- What: {description}
- Expected Impact: {% of problem solved}
- Why Insufficient: {evidence-based reason}

### Why Complex Solution Necessary
1. Simple alternatives fail due to: {specific reason with evidence}
2. Complexity justified by: {benefit simple solutions cannot achieve}
```

Min 2 alternatives. Each: specific description, expected impact, evidence-based rejection.

## Examples

### Example 1: Roadmap Step (Correct)
Schema source-of-truth: `nWave/templates/roadmap-schema.json` (required step fields: `id`, `name`, `criteria` as list[str]).
```json
{
  "id": "01-03",
  "name": "Order processing with payment integration",
  "criteria": [
    "Order confirmed after successful payment",
    "Failed payment returns clear error to caller",
    "Order persists with payment reference"
  ],
  "files_to_modify": [
    "src/order/application/order_service.py",
    "src/order/adapters/payment_gateway.py"
  ],
  "implementation_notes": "Payment gateway accessed through driven port; order aggregate maintains consistency."
}
```

### Example 1b: Functional Paradigm (Correct)
```json
{
  "id": "01-03",
  "name": "Order processing pipeline with payment integration",
  "criteria": [
    "Valid order request produces confirmed order with payment reference",
    "Invalid payment produces domain error value (not exception)",
    "Order state is immutable — processing produces new OrderConfirmed value"
  ],
  "files_to_modify": [
    "src/order/pipeline.py",
    "src/order/payment_port.py"
  ],
  "implementation_notes": "Payment accessed through function-signature port (PaymentRequest -> Result); pipeline composed from pure transformations; effect boundary at adapter layer only."
}
```
Same WHAT-level criteria as Example 1, adapted for FP. No function names or type definitions -- functional-software-crafter decides those.

### Example 2: Roadmap Step (Incorrect -- Implementation Coupled)
```json
{
  "id": "01-03",
  "name": "Implement PaymentProcessor class",
  "criteria": [
    "_validate_card() returns CardValidationResult",
    "PaymentProcessor.charge() uses retry with exponential backoff"
  ]
}
```
Crafter decides class names|method signatures|retry strategies.
