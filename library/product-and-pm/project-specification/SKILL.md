## Delegation

For detailed specification writing workflows, this skill delegates to `spec-kit:spec-writing` as the canonical implementation. Use this skill for quick specification needs; use spec-kit for thorough specification documents.

## When To Use

- After brainstorming phase completes
- Have project brief but need detailed requirements
- Need testable acceptance criteria for implementation
- Planning validation and testing strategy
- Translating business requirements into technical specs
- Defining scope boundaries and out-of-scope items

## When NOT To Use

- Still exploring problem space (use `Skill(attune:project-brainstorming)` instead)
- Already have detailed specification (use `Skill(attune:project-planning)` instead)
- Refining existing implementation (use code review skills)
- Making strategic decisions (use `Skill(attune:war-room)` for complex choices)

## Integration

**With spec-kit**:
- Delegates to `Skill(spec-kit:spec-writing)` for methodology
- Uses spec-kit templates and validation
- Enables clarification workflow

**Without spec-kit**:
- Standalone specification framework
- Requirement templates
- Acceptance criteria patterns

## Record the Tradeoff (decision journal)

If the specification settled a design decision with real alternatives (a chosen
data model, an interface boundary, a constraint accepted), record it to
`docs/tradeoffs.md` before continuing (draft and confirm):

- If leyline is installed, invoke `Skill(leyline:decision-journal)` and append
  a tradeoff entry (the decision, the options weighed, and what was
  sacrificed; set `phase` to `specify`). Show the draft; append on
  confirmation.
- Fallback (leyline absent): append to `docs/tradeoffs.md` using the in-file
  ENTRY TEMPLATE; assign the next `TR-NNN` id.

## Post-Completion: Workflow Continuation (REQUIRED)

**Automatic Trigger**: After Quality Checks pass and `docs/specification.md` is saved, MUST auto-invoke the next phase.

**When continuation is invoked**:
1. Verify `docs/specification.md` exists and is non-empty
2. Display checkpoint message to user:
   ```
   Specification complete. Saved to docs/specification.md.
   Proceeding to planning phase...
   ```
3. Invoke next phase:
   ```
   Skill(attune:project-planning)
   ```

**Bypass Conditions** (ONLY skip continuation if ANY true):
- `--standalone` flag was provided by the user
- `docs/specification.md` does not exist or is empty (phase failed)
- User explicitly requests to stop after specification

**Do NOT prompt the user for confirmation**: this is a lightweight checkpoint, not an interactive gate. The user can always interrupt if needed.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] `docs/specification.md` exists, is non-empty, and passes Quality Checks.
- [ ] Every functional requirement has testable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Any design decision with real alternatives is recorded to
  `docs/tradeoffs.md` (or there was no meaningful design fork).
- [ ] The next phase is auto-invoked unless a bypass condition holds.
