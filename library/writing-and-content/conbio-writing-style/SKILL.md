description: "Use when drafting or polishing a Conservation Biology manuscript so it reads accessibly for a broad conservation audience, follows the journal Style Guide, and fits the per-type word caps (e.g., Contributed Papers ~6,000–7,000; abstract <= 300 words). Tightens prose and format; it does not invent content."

# Writing Style (conbio-writing-style)

A *Conservation Biology* paper must be readable by conservation scientists and practitioners beyond
the author's own system, formatted to the journal **Style Guide**, and disciplined to the per-type word
cap. This skill is about clarity, accessibility, and format — not about generating claims. (Verify the
current per-type caps; they drift between Style Guide versions — see `resources/official-source-map.md`.)

## When to trigger

- Drafting the introduction, framing the contribution, or final polish
- Over the word cap and needing to cut without losing the argument
- Writing the **≤ 300-word abstract**
- Aligning citations/headings/format to the Style Guide before submission

## Reach a broad conservation audience

1. **Front-load the conservation contribution.** By the end of the introduction the reader knows the
   problem, the question, the approach, and **why it matters for conserving biodiversity.** Don't make
   a generalist dig for the "so what."
2. **Minimize system jargon** or define it on first use; a practitioner should follow a population-model
   paper, and a modeler should follow a field study. Spell out acronyms; use accepted species names.
3. **Argument-first prose.** Lead with claims; use evidence to support them. Avoid "the data show…"
   without saying what they show and why it matters for conservation.
4. **Signpost and follow IMRAD.** Contributed Papers, Research Notes, and Practice & Policy follow
   Abstract → Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion; do not combine Results and Discussion, and
   do not add a separate Conclusion (conclusions belong in the Discussion).

## Format to the Style Guide

- **Citations**: author-date per the journal Style Guide; keep one consistent style (manage with
  Zotero/BibTeX). Literature Cited is included in the word count.
- **Title**: clear and concise; avoid hanging (colon/dash) titles, full-sentence titles, and
  interrogative titles per the Style Guide.
- **Anonymize**: the journal is **double-blind** — no author names/affiliations in the manuscript, and
  neutralize obvious self-references; strip identifying file metadata (see `conbio-submission`).
- **Abstract**: **≤ 300 words**, stating problem, approach, and finding (no abstract for Letters,
  Comments, or Diversity).

## Fit the word cap (count runs from first word of Abstract through last word of Literature Cited)

- Note: the count **excludes tables, figure legends, and text inside tables.** Move full model output,
  balance tables, and extended robustness to **Supporting Information**.
- Cut throat-clearing and literature dumps; engage the debate, not every paper (see
  `conbio-literature-positioning`).
- Prefer one decisive figure to three redundant tables (and respect the ~one-exhibit-per-four-pages rule).

## Worked micro-rewrites (Conservation Biology house style)

**Title.** The Style Guide bars hanging, full-sentence, and interrogative titles, so recast the
question or clause as a declarative noun phrase that names taxon, mechanism, and conservation stake.

- Interrogative (rejected): *"Do restored hedgerows recover farmland birds?"*
- Hanging colon (rejected): *"Farmland birds: hedgerow restoration and occupancy."*
- Declarative (accepted): *"Restored hedgerows recover farmland-bird occupancy within five years across
  a fragmented region."* — states the finding, the guild, and the transferable scale in one line.

**Abstract compression.** When the ≤ 300-word abstract runs long, cut in this order: delete
method-brand phrases first ("using a Bayesian implementation"), collapse background to one clause, and
protect the finding-with-direction and the conservation payoff last. A sentence such as *"We conducted
a study in which we surveyed sites and subsequently fitted models to the resulting data"* becomes *"We
surveyed 60 farms and modeled occupancy"* — same content, roughly a third of the units.

**Discussion, not Conclusion.** Because there is no separate Conclusion section, the implications land
in the Discussion. Do not close with an "In conclusion" paragraph; end on the scope-bounded
conservation recommendation instead, and route the so-what through
`conbio-conservation-relevance-and-implications`.

## Cutting to the cap without losing the argument

The count runs Abstract → Literature Cited, so trim where units are cheapest to lose:

- Move full model tables, balance diagnostics, and sensitivity runs to Supporting Information; the
  legend and in-table text do not count, but a wall of in-text numbers does.
- Replace three redundant tables with one decisive figure (honor ~one exhibit per four pages).
- Prune the literature review to the papers you actually argue with; a citation dump inflates Literature
  Cited, which *is* counted, for no argumentative gain.
- Delete throat-clearing ("It is well known that…", "has been studied extensively") on sight.

## Anti-patterns

- A system-insider intro that never states conservation relevance
- Burying the contribution in the middle of the paper
- An abstract over 300 words or one that hides the finding
- Hanging/interrogative/full-sentence titles; mixed citation styles
- A stray "In conclusion" paragraph duplicating the Discussion
- Self-references that break the double-blind; padding a Research Note toward Contributed-Paper length

## Output format

```
【Conservation contribution stated by end of intro?】[Y/N]
【Reads past the system?】jargon defined / acronyms spelled? [Y/N]
【Abstract】word count (≤300)
【Word count】within the article-type cap (Abstract→Literature Cited)?
【Style Guide + anonymized + title style】[Y/N]
【Next】conbio-conservation-relevance-and-implications
```
