# Nature Geoscience Supplementary Information (ngeo-supplementary)

## When to trigger

- The Article is over 3,000 words and detail must move out of the main text
- A reader cannot follow the main text without consulting the Supplementary Information
- You have extended maps, full model ensembles, derivations, or additional proxies with no home
- You are unsure what is allowed in SI versus what must stay in the main text or online Methods
- Referees of a prior version asked for material that would bloat the main text

## The stand-alone rule (non-negotiable)

The main text must be **fully understandable on its own**. The Supplementary Information *supports* the Article; it must never be *load-bearing* for the headline advance. A reader who never opens the SI should still grasp the result, the core evidence for it, its uncertainty, and why it matters.

- The headline advance, its decisive evidence, and the headline uncertainty live in the **main text**.
- The **online Methods** holds the reproducible protocol (instruments, model setup, statistics).
- The **SI** holds the exhaustive backup a skeptical referee or replicator wants: extended datasets, full ensembles, sensitivity tests, additional figures and tables.

If removing the SI breaks the argument, the partition is wrong — pull the essential piece back into the main text (and trim elsewhere via `ngeo-length-management`).

## Methods vs. SI (a common confusion)

Nature Geoscience has *both* an online Methods section and Supplementary Information; they are not the same:

| Content                                              | Home           |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Reproducible protocol (instrument, model config, statistics) | online Methods |
| Full uncertainty budget / error propagation           | online Methods |
| Extended data figures, additional maps/sections       | SI             |
| Full model ensemble members, sensitivity sweeps        | SI             |
| Supporting derivations / lengthy algebra               | SI             |
| Secondary proxies, additional sites, robustness checks | SI             |
| Large data tables                                      | SI             |
| The headline advance and its decisive evidence          | main text      |
| The headline uncertainty                                | main text      |

## SI organization

- Mirror the Article's logic: order SI sections to match the order they are cited in the main text and Methods.
- Give SI sections clear headings and self-contained captions; label figures/tables **Fig. Sn / Table Sn / Supplementary Note n**.
- Every SI item is **cited from the main text or Methods** at the point it is relevant; nothing goes uncited.
- Keep notation, units, and symbol definitions consistent with the main text and Methods.
- Keep the SI honest: it is peer-reviewed alongside the Article, not a place to bury weak results, unvalidated model runs, or claims the referees did not vet.

## Checklist

- [ ] The main text is understandable without ever opening the SI
- [ ] No headline-advance evidence is *only* in the SI
- [ ] Reproducible protocol is in online Methods, not scattered in SI
- [ ] Every SI item is cited from the main text or Methods at the relevant point
- [ ] SI sections ordered to match their citation order
- [ ] SI figures/tables labeled Fig. Sn / Table Sn distinctly
- [ ] Extended data, full ensembles, and derivations live in SI
- [ ] Notation and units consistent across main text, Methods, and SI

## Anti-patterns

- A main text that silently depends on the SI to be understood
- Burying the decisive evidence or headline uncertainty in the SI
- Confusing SI with online Methods (protocol scattered instead of consolidated)
- An SI that is a disorganized dump rather than a structured appendix
- SI items referenced out of order or never cited
- Notation/unit drift between main text, Methods, and SI
- Using SI to smuggle in unvalidated model runs or claims reviewers did not see

## Output format

```
【Main text stands alone】yes / fix (pull back: ...)
【Methods vs. SI split correct】yes / fix
【SI sections】S1: ... / S2: ... (cited from main text/Methods?)
【Headline evidence only in SI?】none / move back: ...
【SI labels】Fig. Sn / Table Sn?  yes / fix
【Notation consistent across all three】yes / fix
【Next】ngeo-writing-style or ngeo-length-management
```
