# POPL Writing Style

A POPL paper convinces twice: informally, that the problem is real and the idea
natural; formally, that the theorems are exactly true. The craft is the ramp between
the two. The 25-pages-of-text budget (POPL 2027 call, read 2026-07-08) is generous
compared with old conference caps — the failure mode is not compression but
*unmotivated formalism*.

## The informal-to-formal ramp

1. **Open with a program, not a framework.** Page 1 should show concrete code or a
   concrete derivation that misbehaves — the phenomenon your formalism explains.
2. **State the contribution as a sharp claim.** "We prove type soundness for λ_X
   with feature Y, the first such result without assumption Z" beats any paragraph
   of positioning.
3. **Walk the example through the machinery** before generalizing: the reader should
   predict each definition because the example demanded it.
4. **Main theorem by the end of the overview section**, at least informally: what is
   proved, under what assumptions, and what is *not* claimed.
5. Only then the full calculus — and every rule shown in the body should be a rule
   the text actually discusses (`popl-supplementary` takes the rest).

## Notation is load-bearing

| Symptom | Cost at review | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Same meta-variable for terms and types | Reviewers misread a rule, file a soundness doubt | One notation table, enforced by grep |
| Definitions used pages before they appear | "Paper is unreadable" reviews | Definition-before-use audit on every draft |
| Ambient hypotheses ("we assume all contexts well-formed" once, on p. 6) | Counterexamples that your hidden assumption excludes | Number assumptions; cite by number in each theorem |
| Overloaded ⊢ with no annotation | Rule-reading errors in the response phase | Subscript every judgment form |

## Proof sketches that earn trust

A body sketch is not a shortened proof; it is a *risk disclosure*. Name the induction
measure, name the case that fails naively, and say what saves it:

```text
Proof sketch (Thm 4.1). By induction on the typing derivation. The interesting
case is T-Close: the naive IH is too weak because the closure captures a
context extension. We strengthen the statement to quantify over all well-formed
extensions (Lem 4.3); the remaining cases are routine and mechanized (Sound.v).
```

A reviewer who reads that sketch knows you met the hard case, and the appendix or
mechanization confirms it.

## Significance, POPL-flavored

- Frame the payoff as **transferable**: "the proof method applies to any calculus
  with property P," "the logic is parametric in the memory model."
- Do not oversell breadth a theorem does not have; scoping sentences ("we treat the
  sequential fragment; concurrency is future work") pre-empt the significance
  reviewer rather than arming them.
- Avoid empirical-style adjectives ("fast," "practical") unless `popl-experiments`
  backs them; at this venue an unsupported "practical" is an invited objection.
- Related-work sentences state technical deltas, not lists (`popl-related-work`).

## Output format

```text
[Ramp audit] <page where a concrete example appears / where the main claim is first stated>
[Notation risks] <overloads, forward references, ambient assumptions>
[Sketch quality] <per main theorem: hard case named? measure named?>
[Overclaim scan] <sentences claiming more than the theorems>
[Cut list] <formal material in the body that no text discusses>
```
