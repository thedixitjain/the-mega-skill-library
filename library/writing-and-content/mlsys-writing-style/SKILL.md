# MLSys Writing Style

Use this during drafting and revision. MLSys prose sits between two failure modes: the
ML-paper voice (contribution bullets, related-work-first, benchmarks as decoration) and
the tech-report voice (system tour, feature list, "extensive experiments"). The venue's
own genre is different: a paper here is an *argument about where time, memory, or money
goes* in an ML workload, and how a named idea changes that.

## The first-page arc

1. **Bottleneck, measured.** Open with the profiling fact that justifies the paper —
   a percentage, a stall, a cost line — on a workload the reader recognizes. If the
   introduction's first numbers appear in the evaluation section, the order is wrong.
2. **Why existing designs cannot remove it.** Mechanistic reasons per named system or
   design family, not "prior work is limited."
3. **Insight.** The one observation that unlocks the design, stated in a sentence a
   reader could repeat tomorrow.
4. **Mechanism, named.** Give the technique a noun. Anonymous "several optimizations"
   is how research contributions disappear into engineering.
5. **Payoff with scope.** Ranged improvement, named baseline, stated cost or non-win.

## Sentence-level rewrites

| Draft pattern | MLSys-safe rewrite |
|---|---|
| "achieves up to 3.4x speedup" | "1.6-2.2x goodput at matched p99 across three traces (3.4x peak on the bursty trace)" |
| "significantly reduces memory" | "cuts peak activation memory 38% (Fig. 5), enabling batch 32 on one A100" |
| "our highly optimized implementation" | name the three optimizations and ablate them |
| "extensive experiments demonstrate" | "we answer four questions: (RQ1)..." |
| "existing systems suffer from poor utilization" | "SystemX idles the interconnect 41% of decode time on this trace (§2)" |
| "we believe this generalizes to other accelerators" | state the mechanism's hardware assumptions; claim only what was measured |

## Evaluation sections answer questions

Structure the evaluation as research questions, each mapped to figures that answer it:

```text
6. Evaluation
   RQ1  Does <mechanism> improve end-to-end serving under realistic load?   (6.2)
   RQ2  Where does the gain come from?  [ablation per component]            (6.3)
   RQ3  When does it *not* help?  [load shapes, model sizes, hardware]      (6.4)
   RQ4  What does it cost?  [memory, complexity, build time, $ ]            (6.5)
```

RQ3 and RQ4 are not optional at this venue; their absence is the strongest style-level
predictor of skeptical reviews. A results tour organized by dataset instead of by
question reads as unanalyzed output.

## Numbers discipline

- Every performance number carries its workload, hardware, and variance context on
  first mention; naked speedups are marketing.
- Prefer goodput/latency-constrained framings over raw throughput when serving is
  involved — systems readers discount throughput wins that trash tails.
- Use consistent units and precision; a table mixing ms, s, and "x" invites arithmetic
  audits.
- When a number is estimated (cost models, projections to larger scale), typographically
  separate it from measured results and say how it was estimated.

## Compression into 10 two-column pages

- The design section earns space in proportion to what the evaluation ablates; a
  component never ablated should be described in two sentences, not two columns.
- Background sections rarely deserve more than half a page — MLSys readers know the
  transformer, the GPU memory hierarchy, and the serving stack; spend the space on
  *your* workload characterization instead.
- Architecture diagrams beat prose walkthroughs; one good figure with numbered dataflow
  arrows replaces a column of "then the request is forwarded to."
- Move full configuration matrices to the separately-uploaded appendix, but keep the
  fairness-critical facts (baseline tuning budget) in the body — reviewers are not
  obliged to open the appendix.
- References are excluded from the 10 pages and must list all authors (2026 rule), so
  never compress by mutilating the bibliography.

## Figures and tables carry the paper

Systems reviewers form their judgment from the exhibits, then read prose to confirm it.

- The architecture figure: numbered dataflow, the new components visually distinct from
  inherited infrastructure, and no internal codenames. If a reader cannot locate the
  contribution in this figure, the design section will not save it.
- The money figure: one plot that shows the headline claim with its constraint —
  typically goodput versus load with a p99 ceiling marked, both systems on the same
  axes. Reviewers screenshot this one into their reviews.
- Every performance plot states hardware and trial count in the caption; captions are
  read during skims, body text is not.
- Log-scale axes are honest for spanning regimes but must be labeled loudly; a log axis
  that makes a 1.3x gap look large will be caught and remembered.
- Tables: bold the best number per row only if "best" is defined in the caption;
  include the variance column; never mix measured and projected numbers in one table
  without typographic separation.

## Title and abstract mechanics

- Titles at this venue name the system or mechanism and the setting ("X: <mechanism>
  for <workload class>"); cleverness that hides the topic costs discovery, since
  practitioners search proceedings by problem.
- The abstract must contain at least one measured number with its workload context —
  an abstract with no number reads as a position paper here.
- Spell out the ML property and system constraint being co-designed in the first two
  sentences; abstract readers include the reviewers bidding on papers, and bidding
  mismatch produces the wrong panel (see `mlsys-review-process`).

## Anonymization without lobotomy (research track)

Blinding at a systems venue tempts authors to delete the deployment context that makes
the paper credible. Keep the facts, drop the identity: "a production recommendation
service serving tens of millions of daily requests" survives review; the company name
returns at camera-ready. Scrub cluster hostnames and internal codenames from figures —
profiler screenshots are the classic leak.

## Output format

```text
[Diagnosis] tech-report voice / ML-paper voice / MLSys-ready
[First-page arc] <bottleneck number present? insight? named mechanism? scoped payoff?>
[RQ structure] <RQ list; RQ3 (non-wins) and RQ4 (costs) present?>
[Claim rewrites] <naked number -> contextualized rewrite>
[Compression cuts] <un-ablated design prose, background, config matrices to move>
[Anonymity edits] <identity leaks to fix without deleting context>
```
