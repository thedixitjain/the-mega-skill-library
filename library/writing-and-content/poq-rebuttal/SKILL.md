# R&R Rebuttal (poq-rebuttal)

A POQ **R&R is an opportunity** — but the referees are survey scientists, and their comments often turn
on **Total Survey Error** (coverage, nonresponse, wording, mode, weighting) and **AAPOR disclosure**.
The response letter must move *every* referee toward yes on both substance and method, while keeping
the **associate editor** confident the revision is convergent.

## When to trigger

- An R&R decision arrived and you are planning the revision + response letter
- Referees disagree with each other and you must reconcile their demands
- A referee requests new weighting, robustness, or disclosure that touches the claims
- Writing the cover note to the AE summarizing the revision

## Strategy

1. **Read the AE's letter as the rubric.** The associate editor signals which points are decisive.
   Solve those first; the AE adjudicates disagreements among referees.
2. **One point-by-point response, every comment addressed.** Quote each comment, then respond. Never
   skip one — silence reads as non-compliance.
3. **Answer survey-error objections with evidence, not assertion.** When a referee questions
   nonresponse bias, mode effects, wording, or weighting, respond with an added analysis, a sensitivity
   check, or an explicit disclosure update — point to the revised Appendix A / table / figure.
4. **Concede or rebut explicitly.** For each: did what was asked (say where, with the new
   text/table/figure number), or push back **respectfully with a methodological reason**. Referees
   respect a well-argued disagreement grounded in survey science.
5. **Reconcile conflicting referees openly.** When R2 wants the opposite of R3, say so, choose a
   principled path, and explain the tradeoff to the AE.
6. **Protect the contribution.** Add robustness and disclosure; resist changes that dilute the opinion
   or survey-validity claim that earned the R&R. Defend scope conditions rather than over-claiming.
7. **Keep anonymity intact** in the revised manuscript (still double-blind), and **update the
   replication package and Appendix A** so new tables/figures remain reproducible and disclosed (see
   `poq-transparency-and-data-policy`).

## Response-letter format

For each referee comment:

```
> [Quoted referee comment]

Response: [What we did / why we respectfully disagree, on survey-science grounds].
Change: [Section/page/table-figure/Appendix-A location where the revision appears].
```

Open with a short **summary of the main changes** to the AE; group by referee; end each entry with the
location of every change so the editor can verify quickly.

## Synchronize the revision package

POQ revisions often fail because the manuscript, Appendix A, replication files, and response letter drift apart. Maintain a package ledger:

| Changed item | Manuscript location | Appendix A / supplement | Deposited file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New weight or variance estimator | Methods/results section and table note | Updated weighting/design-effect disclosure | Analysis script and output |
| Revised response-rate calculation | Methods and disclosure paragraph | Disposition-code table | Calculation worksheet |
| New question wording or split ballot | Survey design section | Exact wording and order | Instrument file |
| New robustness or sensitivity check | Short main-text pointer | Full table/figure | Code and data extract |

Before resubmission, read the response letter against the ledger. Every "we added" sentence needs a manuscript or appendix location, and every new exhibit needs a reproducible source.

## Anti-patterns

- Ignoring or merging away a comment without a visible response
- Answering a nonresponse/mode/weighting objection with assertion rather than analysis or disclosure
- Capitulating to a request that breaks the design's logic just to please a referee
- Defensive or dismissive tone toward referees
- Letting the revised manuscript, Appendix A, or new exhibits drift out of sync with the deposited package
- Reporting a new robustness result in the letter but leaving Appendix A or replication files unchanged

## Output format

```
【AE's decisive points】addressed first? [list]
【Coverage】every referee comment answered? [Y/N]
【Survey-error objections】each met with analysis/disclosure + change location
【Concede vs rebut】each tagged with evidence + location
【Referee conflicts】reconciled and explained to AE? [Y/N]
【Contribution protected】no dilution of opinion / survey-validity claim? [Y/N]
【Anonymity + package + Appendix A updated】[Y/N]
【Package ledger】manuscript / Appendix A / deposit synchronized? [Y/N]
【Next】resubmit via ScholarOne Manuscripts
```
