# AAMAS Writing Style

Use this when revising the main paper. AAMAS papers need a compact statement of why an
*interaction* result matters and enough detail for a game theorist and an empiricist to both
validate it.

## Revision rules

- Put the interaction contribution on the first page: the multiagent problem, why single-agent
  or centralized fixes fail, the mechanism or learning rule, the strategic property, and the
  evidence.
- Name the solution concept or incentive property (Nash, correlated, coarse-correlated,
  no-regret, dominant-strategy truthful, Pareto); an unnamed "equilibrium" is a review flag.
- Make the game legible: agents, actions, information structure, and payoffs stated once and
  clearly.
- Pair every major claim with a proof sketch, a self-play or population experiment, or a
  deployment result.
- Use the 8-page body for the core argument and push long proofs, extra opponents, and extended
  ablations to the appendix (references are unlimited, so cite generously).
- Keep double-blind wording in self-citations, prior-system references, acknowledgements, and
  artifact descriptions.

## Interaction-first discipline

- State early why the result is genuinely multiagent - what breaks if the other agents are
  frozen into a static environment. If nothing breaks, the AAMAS framing does not hold.
- Give each theorem a body-level proof sketch; the appendix proof supports the sketch but never
  replaces it.
- Keep the game's information structure visible; who knows what and when is where multiagent
  proofs live or die.
- Separate a *proved* strategic property from an *observed* one; mixing "is truthful" and
  "appears cooperative" in one paragraph is a credibility leak here.

## Sentence-level rewrites

| Draft pattern | AAMAS-safe rewrite |
|---|---|
| "Our agents outperform the baselines..." | "reduce social cost by X (SE Y) over Z seeds against held-out opponents" |
| "The agents reach equilibrium..." | "converge to a coarse-correlated equilibrium (Def. 2) under Assumptions 1-3" |
| "The mechanism is fair and efficient..." | "is dominant-strategy truthful (Thm. 1) with efficiency loss bounded by ... (Thm. 2)" |
| "In a multiagent setting..." | Name the game, the number of agents, and the information structure |

## Vignette: compressing into eight two-column pages

A draft with two theorems, a mechanism, six figures, and a sprawling related-work section: keep
both theorem statements with one sketch each, the mechanism definition, and the two
decision-critical figures (truthfulness-under-learning and the efficiency gap); compress related
work into precise contrasts; move secondary lemmas and four figures to the appendix with forward
references. The test of a good cut: a reviewer reconstructs the whole interaction argument
without opening the supplement.

## Output format

```text
[Writing diagnosis] clear / interaction-buried / concept-unnamed / overloaded
[First-page fix] <new interaction framing>
[Claim discipline] <claim -> proof / experiment / limitation>
[Compression cuts] <move / delete / merge>
[Anonymity edits] <phrases to rewrite>
```
