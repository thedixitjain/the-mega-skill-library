# Writing Style & Exposition (jf-writing-style)

## When to trigger

- The introduction does not deliver the question, finding, and magnitude in the first page
- Prose is dense, jargon-heavy, or written for a subfield rather than the broad AFA reader
- The main finding is buried; the reader has to work to extract the takeaway
- Sentences hedge so much the claim disappears

## JF house voice: accessible, precise, general-interest

JF is the **AFA flagship**, read across asset pricing, corporate finance, banking, microstructure, and household finance by 8,000+ readers. Writing must be **accessible to a finance reader outside your subfield** while staying precise. The manuscript also faces a **60-page limit** (≥1.5 spacing, 12-pt font), so lead with economics and **offload technical depth to the Internet Appendix** (bundled at the end of the same PDF; see `jf-internet-appendix`) rather than padding the body.

## The JF introduction (first ~3 pages do the work)

In order: (1) **the question and why it matters** — general-interest, concrete; (2) **what you do** — design/data/test in plain terms; (3) **what you find** — headline result with its **economic magnitude** in interpretable units; (4) **why it is credible** — the source of variation or the test; (5) **contribution** — the closest papers and your delta (see `jf-literature-positioning`); (6) brief roadmap. A reader who stops at page 3 should know the question, the answer, its size, and why to believe it.

## Sentence-level discipline

- Active voice and short declaratives for main claims.
- State magnitudes in interpretable units (bps, % of market cap, Sharpe gain), not only t-stats.
- Define notation once; do not re-derive in prose what a table shows.
- Cut hedging stacks to one calibrated claim.
- Use "significant" for economic importance, not as a synonym for the p-value.

## Page-one diagnostic grid

Test a JF introduction by reading only page one and asking whether each element is present — the pass an out-of-subfield editor makes:

| By the bottom of page one, the reader knows…    | If absent, the fix                                |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| The question and why it is first-order          | Open with the stake, not the literature           |
| What you do, in plain terms                     | One sentence on design/data/test, no notation     |
| The headline finding                            | State the result before its caveats               |
| Its economic magnitude in interpretable units   | Add the bps / Sharpe gain / % of value            |
| Why it is credible                              | Name the shock, instrument, or asset-pricing test |

A subfield draft typically fails on magnitude or credibility, assuming the reader cares.

## Worked vignette — rewriting a buried opening

*Illustrative.* A draft opens: "A large literature examines the cross-section of expected returns. We contribute to it." The result arrives three paragraphs later. The JF rewrite leads on page one:

> "Firms exposed to supply-chain concentration earn 45 bps per month higher returns (Sharpe gain ≈ 0.4, illustrative). The premium survives standard factor adjustment and concentrates where arbitrage is costly, pointing to mispricing over risk."

The page-one reader now has the question, answer, size, and reason to believe; the survey citation moves into the contribution paragraph (`jf-literature-positioning`).

### Referee-pushback patterns and the JF-specific fix
| Pushback on the prose                              | JF-specific fix                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| "I read three pages before the finding"            | Move question + result + magnitude to page one                  |
| "Significant at 1%' is reported as the result"     | Replace with the magnitude; keep the t-stat in a note           |
| "The body is padded toward 60 pages"               | Offload derivations/notation to the Internet Appendix           |

## Calibration anchors
- JF's voice is **accessible but precise** — not a popular-science register; the goal is a finance economist outside your niche following the argument. The "first three pages do the work" norm is durable, but exact length conventions vary; confirm against the journal's current author guidelines.

## Checklist

- [ ] Question, finding, and economic magnitude in the first ~3 pages
- [ ] Headline number in interpretable economic units
- [ ] A non-specialist finance reader could follow the introduction
- [ ] Heavy notation/derivation moved to the Internet Appendix, keeping the body ≤60 pages
- [ ] Active voice; calibrated (not reflexive) hedging
- [ ] Abstract matches the introduction's claims

## Anti-patterns

- Opening with three paragraphs of literature before the question
- Reporting "significant at the 1% level" as if it were the finding
- Subfield jargon with no plain-language gloss for the broad AFA reader
- Padding the body toward the 60-page cap instead of using the Internet Appendix
- Over-hedged claims that blur the contribution

## Output format

```
【Question+finding+magnitude in first 3 pp?】yes / no
【Magnitude in economic units?】yes / no
【Accessible to non-specialist?】yes / no
【Notation moved to Internet Appendix?】yes / no
【Body ≤60 pp / hedging trimmed?】yes / no
【Next step】jf-submission
```
