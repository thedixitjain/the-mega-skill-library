## When To Use

- Browsing available hookify rules by category
- Installing standard pre-built rules into a project
- Looking for ready-made rules before writing custom ones

## When NOT To Use

- Writing custom rules from scratch: use `hookify:writing-rules` instead
- Debugging or modifying existing installed rules
- Converting Python SDK hooks: use `hookify:from-hook` instead

python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py git:block-force-push
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py --category git
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py --all
```
**Verification:** Run `python --version` to verify Python environment.

## Installation Instructions

### Method 1: Claude-Assisted (Recommended)

When you invoke this skill, tell Claude which rule(s) to install:

```
**Verification:** Run `git status` to confirm working tree state.
Install git:block-force-push
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

Claude will:
1. Read the rule from `skills/rule-catalog/rules/git/block-force-push.md`
2. Write it to `.claude/hookify.block-force-push.local.md`
3. Confirm installation

### Method 2: Python Script

For bulk operations or automation:

```bash
# Install single rule
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py git:block-force-push

# Install all rules in category
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py --category python

# Install all rules
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py --all

# List available rules
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py --list

# Install to custom directory
python3 plugins/hookify/scripts/install_rule.py git:block-force-push --target /path/to/.claude
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

### Method 3: Manual Copy

1. Find rule in `plugins/hookify/skills/rule-catalog/rules/<category>/<rule>.md`
2. Copy to `.claude/hookify.<rule-name>.local.md`
3. Edit `enabled: true/false` as needed

## Rule File Locations

Rules are stored relative to this skill:

# Change action from warn to block
action: block

# Disable temporarily
enabled: false

# Modify pattern
pattern: your-custom-pattern
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

## Creating Pull Requests for New Rules

To add rules to the catalog:

1. Create rule file in appropriate category
2. Follow naming convention: `kebab-case.md`
3. Include detailed message with alternatives
4. Test thoroughly before submitting
5. Update this SKILL.md catalog table

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Installed rule file exists at
  `.claude/hookify.<rule-name>.local.md` with `enabled: true`
  in its frontmatter
- [ ] Rule activates without requiring a session restart; verified
  by triggering a matching pattern and observing the warn or
  block response
- [ ] When installing via Python script, exit code 0 is returned
  and the rule file is present at the target path
- [ ] Rule file structure matches the catalog source at
  `skills/rule-catalog/rules/<category>/<rule>.md`; no fields
  silently dropped during installation
