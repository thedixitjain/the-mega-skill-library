# AI Slop Remediation Strategies

Guidance for fixing detected slop patterns while preserving meaning.

## Core Principles

1. **Preserve meaning**: Never change what's said, only how it's said
2. **Match context**: Technical docs need different fixes than narratives
3. **Maintain voice**: If the document has established tone, preserve it
4. **Incremental changes**: Edit section by section, not wholesale rewrites
5. **Ask before gutting**: Major restructuring requires user approval

## Vocabulary Remediation

### Direct Substitutions

| AI Word | Context | Replacements |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| delve | exploration | explore, examine, look at, dig into |
| leverage | usage | use, apply, employ |
| utilize | usage | use |
| embark | starting | begin, start, launch |
| comprehensive | scope | thorough, complete, full |
| robust | quality | solid, strong, reliable |
| seamless | integration | smooth, easy, simple |
| pivotal | importance | key, important, critical |
| multifaceted | complexity | complex, varied, diverse |
| nuanced | detail | subtle, detailed, fine-grained |
| streamline | improvement | simplify, improve, speed up |
| optimize | improvement | improve, tune, adjust |
| facilitate | enablement | enable, help, allow |
| utilize | use | use |

### Phrase Substitutions

| AI Phrase | Replacement Options |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "In today's fast-paced world" | [Delete entirely] or start with the actual point |
| "It's worth noting that" | [Delete] - just state the thing |
| "At its core" | "Fundamentally" or [delete] |
| "Cannot be overstated" | "is important" or "matters because [reason]" |
| "Navigate the complexities" | "handle", "work through", "deal with" |
| "Unlock the potential" | "enable", "allow", "make possible" |
| "A testament to" | "shows", "demonstrates", "proves" |
| "Treasure trove" | "collection", "set", "many" |

## Structural Remediation

### Reducing Em Dashes

Replace with:
- Commas for brief asides
- Parentheses for tangential info
- Periods for complete thoughts
- Colons for introductions

Before: "The system—which was designed for scale—handles millions of requests."
After: "The system handles millions of requests. It was designed for scale."

### Converting Bullets to Prose

Before:
```
Key benefits:
- Fast processing
- Easy integration
- Low maintenance
```

After:
"The system processes quickly, integrates without friction, and requires little upkeep."

### Varying Sentence Length

If all sentences are 15-20 words, intersperse:
- Short punchy statements (5-8 words)
- Longer explanatory sentences (25-30 words)
- Questions or fragments for emphasis

### Adding Contractions

Replace formal constructions:
- "do not" -> "don't"
- "cannot" -> "can't"
- "it is" -> "it's"
- "we will" -> "we'll"

Exception: Legal, academic, or formal documents may require formality.

## Tone Remediation

### Removing Sycophancy

| Remove | Replace With |
|--------|--------------|
| "Great question!" | [Delete, just answer] |
| "I'd be happy to" | [Delete, just do it] |
| "Absolutely!" | [Delete or use sparingly] |
| "That's a wonderful point" | [Delete] |

### Adding Authorial Voice

Insert:
- First-person perspective where appropriate
- Specific examples from real experience
- Acknowledgment of limitations or unknowns
- Trade-off discussions with reasoning

Before: "This approach optimizes performance."
After: "We chose this approach because it cut latency by 40% in our tests, though it uses more memory."

### Grounding Abstract Claims

Before: "This provides comprehensive coverage."
After: "This covers all 47 API endpoints documented in v2.3."

## Section-by-Section Workflow

For documents over 200 lines:

1. **Scan entire document** for slop density
2. **Prioritize sections** by severity
3. **Present each section** to user with proposed changes
4. **Wait for approval** before proceeding
5. **Track changes** in a summary

```markdown
## Section 3: API Overview (Lines 45-89)

**Slop Score**: 4.2 (Moderate)

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Line 47: "delve into" -> "examine"
2. Line 52: Remove "In today's fast-paced world"
3. Lines 60-75: Convert bullet list to two paragraphs

Proceed with these changes? [Y/n/edit]
```

## Docstring Remediation

Special rules for code comments:

1. **Imperative mood**: "Validate" not "Validates"
2. **No surrounding code changes**: Only modify the comment text
3. **Preserve parameter documentation**: Keep Args/Returns format
4. **Brief is better**: Remove filler, keep essential info

Before:
```python
def process(data):
    """
    This function processes the data in a comprehensive manner,
    leveraging advanced algorithms to optimize the output.
    """
```

After:
```python
def process(data):
    """Process input data and return optimized result."""
```

## When NOT to Remediate

- **Quoted material**: Don't change quotes from other sources
- **Historical documents**: Preserve original language
- **Intentional style**: Some "AI-like" formality may be intentional
- **User preference**: If user wants formal tone, respect it

## Tier 5 / 2026 Remediations

These complement the older substitutions above. Apply during
the Pass-5 prose sweep and during prevention-mode generation.

### Copula-Avoidance Verbs (Spatial / Animated)

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "lives in" / "lives at" | "is in" / "is at" |
| "sits at" / "sits between" / "sits within" | "is at" / "is between" / "is in" |
| "stands as" | "is" or delete |
| "rests on" | "depends on" / "uses" |
| "rooted in" | "based on" / "comes from" |
| "anchored in" | "based on" / delete |
| "nestled in" | "in" |
| "serves as" | "is" |
| "marks" (a turning point/shift) | "starts" / "begins" / delete |
| "represents" (a shift/transformation) | "is" or delete |
| "embodies" | "is" or "shows" |
| "boasts" | "has" |
| "features" (as main verb) | "has" / "includes" |
| "encompasses" | "covers" / "includes" |

**Heuristic:** if the subject cannot literally do the verb,
replace with "is", "has", or "uses".

### Plus-Sign Conjunction

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "hooks and skills" | "hooks and skills" |
| "Python and Rust workflow" | "Python and Rust workflow" |
| "API and cache" | "API and cache" |
| "fast and cheap" | "fast and cheap" |

Exception: keep in code blocks, version strings ("3.11+"),
stack labels in diagrams, math.

### Em-Dash Replacement (Prevention Mode)

| Original | Replacement | When |
|----------|-------------|------|
| "X — Y — Z" | "X, Y, Z" | Brief aside |
| "X — a Y — Z" | "X (a Y) Z" | Tangential definition |
| "X — and Y" | "X. And Y." | Dramatic pause |
| "X — Y." | "X: Y." | Definition / list-lead |
| "X — Y." | "X. Y." | Two complete thoughts |

### Semicolon Splice (Prevention Mode)

A prose semicolon joining two independent clauses almost always
reads more naturally as two sentences or one coordinating
conjunction. Rephrase in this order. Keep the semicolon only
when removing it creates ambiguity.

| Original | Replacement | When |
|----------|-------------|------|
| "X; it does Y." | "X. It does Y." | Default: two complete thoughts |
| "X; it does Y." | "X, and it does Y." | Clauses are tightly linked |
| "X; therefore Y." | "X, so Y." | Causal link |
| "X; however Y." | "X, but Y." or "X. However, Y." | Contrast |
| "a, b; c, d; e, f" | (keep the semicolons) | List items carry internal commas |

Confidence is low: surface every prose semicolon for a human to
judge against "absolutely necessary" rather than auto-rewriting.

### Negative Parallelism (Contrastive Negation)

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "It's not X, it's Y" | "It is Y" (state Y positively; avoid the "Y, not X" tail, which is itself flagged) |
| "Y, not X" (trailing) | "Y instead of X" (when the contrast carries information) or "Y" (drop the tail) |
| "Not just X, but Y" | "X and Y" or "X. Also Y." |
| "Not only X, but also Y" | "X and Y" |
| "No X. No Y. Just Z." | "Zero X. Zero Y. Only Z." (rare) or "Z, with no X or Y" |
| "No X, no Y, no Z" | "Z, with no X or Y" |
| "Not because X. Because Y." | "Because Y" (drop the "not X" half) |
| "X. That's it. That's the Y." | "X is the Y." |
| "And that's okay." | Delete |

The replacements remove the rhetorical scaffold and state the
claim directly.

### Contrastive Parallelism (Affirmative Antithesis)

The affirmative sibling: parallel clauses in opposition with no
"not" anchor. Keep it only when the contrast is load-bearing
and used once; otherwise state the point plainly.

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "Less config, more code" | "Setup is one file; the rest is code" |
| "Where others X, we Y" | "We do Y" (drop the unnamed comparison) |
| "Humans propose; machines dispose" | "A human picks; the agent applies" (when both sides are concrete) |
| "Old way: X. New way: Y." | "Y replaces X" |

Subject-swap clauses and chiasmus are judgment-level
(`confidence: low`); surface for human decision rather than
auto-rewriting. Leave `Before:`/`After:` labels on code
examples alone.

### Throat-Clearing Openers

| Slop opener | Replacement |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Here's the thing," | Delete; start at substance |
| "Look," (sentence opener) | Delete |
| "So," (non-contrastive) | Delete |
| "The thing is," | Delete |
| "Let that sink in." | Delete |
| "The uncomfortable truth is" | Delete; state the truth directly |
| "This matters because" | Delete the framing; state why directly |
| "Let me explain." | Delete; just explain |
| "Bear with me." | Delete |

### Significance Cluster

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "stands as a testament to" | "shows" / delete |
| "marks a turning point" | "is when X changed" |
| "represents a shift" | "is a shift" or describe the shift |
| "indelible mark" | name the specific effect |
| "deeply rooted" | "old" / "longstanding" |
| "setting the stage for" | "before" / "leading to" |
| "shaping the future of" | name the specific influence |
| "underscores the importance" | "is important because" |
| "plays a pivotal role" | "is central" or describe the role |

### Three-Fragment Burst

When you see "X. Y. Z." with three short fragments, ask:
*does the rhythm carry information, or is it ornament?* If
ornament, replace with a complete sentence.

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "Focused. Aligned. Measurable." | "Focused, aligned, measurable." or full sentence |
| "Fast. Reliable. Cheap." | "Fast, reliable, and cheap." |
| "Built. Tested. Shipped." | "Built, tested, and shipped." |

### Loop/Signal/Cascade Vocabulary

| Slop | Replacement |
|------|-------------|
| "unpack this" | "explain" / "go through" |
| "surface the issue" | "raise" / "report" |
| "a quiet shift" | name the shift |
| "the signal here is" | "the point is" |
| "a sharp framing" | describe the framing |
| "feedback loop" (non-control) | describe the actual mechanism |
