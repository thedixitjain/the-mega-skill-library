# RecSys Topic Selection

Use this before writing. RecSys is a **single-domain** venue: it is strongest when the central
claim is about **recommendation** — ranking objectives, user/item modeling, offline/online
evaluation, feedback loops, exposure and fairness, or deployed recommender behavior. Being merely
*applicable* to recommendation is not enough; the contribution has to speak to a recommender
audience.

## Fit test

- Prefer RecSys when the main claim is a recommendation result: a ranking objective, a
  user/session model, an evaluation protocol, an off-policy/counterfactual method, a
  fairness/diversity/exposure result, or a deployed-system insight.
- Route to **SIGIR** when the core is ad-hoc retrieval, search ranking, or IR evaluation not tied
  to recommendation.
- Route to **KDD** when the contribution is a general data-mining or large-scale algorithm and
  recommendation is just one application.
- Route to **WSDM / TheWebConf (WWW)** when the emphasis is web-scale search-and-mining or web
  systems broadly.
- Route to **UAI** or an ML venue when the contribution is a general learning/probabilistic
  advance rather than recommender-specific evidence.
- Route to **CHI / CSCW** when user or community outcomes dominate over the recommendation
  algorithm.

## Fit signal table

| Signal in the project | RecSys reading |
|---|---|
| A ranking/user-modeling idea evaluated with tuned baselines and a leakage-aware split | Core fit — the house genre |
| Off-policy or counterfactual evaluation of recommendations | Core fit — a RecSys distinctive |
| A deployed system with production constraints and A/B evidence | Core fit — route to the Industry track |
| A reproduction/refutation of prior recommender results | Core fit — route to the Reproducibility track |
| A general retrieval or mining method, recommendation as one demo | Better at SIGIR / KDD / WSDM |
| A general ML method with a recommender benchmark tacked on | Better at an ML venue |

## Which RecSys track

- Main long paper: a rounded recommendation contribution with offline (and ideally online)
  evidence.
- Main short / Past-Present-Future: one focused finding, or a reflective/forward-looking position.
- Reproducibility: repeating, refuting, or re-scoping prior results; a dataset or framework.
- Industry: a deployed system with production constraints and live evidence.
- Resource / Dataset: a community dataset or software resource with build methodology.

## Vignette: where an exposure-correction method goes

A project delivers an off-policy ranker with an exposure-corrected estimator and a simulator
bridge. RecSys reading: strong fit — a recommendation-specific evaluation advance is exactly what
the venue rewards, Main long paper. Strip the recommendation framing and keep only a generic
off-policy estimator, and it drifts toward an ML venue; turn it into a reproduction of three
published rankers, and the Reproducibility track becomes the right home.

## Sharpening moves before committing

- Name the recommendation primitive: the ranking objective, the user/item model, the evaluation
  protocol, or the deployment claim. If none exists, the RecSys framing does not.
- Confirm the evidence can meet the venue's evaluation bar (tuned baselines, leakage-aware split,
  reported variance) — decoration-only benchmarks are a quiet fit failure here.
- Topic emphasis and the track lineup drift between cycles (2026 dropped LBR, added R&P Notes);
  scan the current CFP before final routing.

## Output format

```text
[Fit] strong RecSys / possible RecSys / better elsewhere
[Best venue] RecSys / SIGIR / KDD / WSDM / TheWebConf / UAI / CHI / ML venue / other
[RecSys track] main-long / main-short / past-present-future / reproducibility / industry / resource
[Contribution sentence] <one sentence>
[Top rejection risk] <novelty / evaluation validity / scope / fit>
[Next action] <experiment, framing, or venue switch>
```
