# Main-Text Writing & Structure (cell-writing)

## When to trigger

- Unsure how a Cell Article is structured.
- The main text is over length, or the Discussion repeats the Results.
- The Methods are written as a free-text section (Cell uses STAR Methods).
- Results wander instead of advancing the single narrative arc.

## Cell Article structure (in order)

1. **Summary** — single paragraph, ≤ ~150 words (`cell-summary`).
2. **Introduction** — ≈3–4 short paragraphs setting up the hypothesis (`cell-framing`).
3. **Results** — the bulk; organized by the arc, **with descriptive subheadings**.
4. **Discussion** — concise interpretation, limitations, significance; does **not** re-list results.
5. **STAR Methods** — Structured, Transparent, Accessible Reporting (separate skill, `cell-star-methods`).
6. **Figure legends** — each stands alone (title + per-panel + statistics).
7. **References** — author–date style (`cell-citation`).
8. **Supplemental information** — supporting figures/tables/videos.

> Cell does **not** use a free-text Methods section — methods live in **STAR Methods** with a Key Resources Table. This is non-negotiable for Cell Press.

## Length and display-item budget

- **Main text** ≈ **45,000 characters including spaces** (this typically counts Introduction, Results, Discussion, **and figure legends**, but not STAR Methods/references) — a working target; confirm the current cap.
- **Display items**: up to ~**7–8** figures/tables typical for a Cell Article; additional supporting items go to Supplemental Information.
- STAR Methods and references are outside the main-text character budget but have their own expectations.

> Numbers are working targets. The principle is fixed: Cell Articles are full stories but tightly written; supporting detail goes to Supplemental Information and STAR Methods.

## Results: subheadings that carry the arc

- Use **descriptive subheadings** that read as mini-claims ("Protein X is required for Y", not "Microscopy experiments").
- Each Results block: **claim sentence first**, then the evidence (figure callout + numbers + statistics), then the inference.
- Order by the **logic of the argument** (phenomenon → mechanism → causality → generality), not by chronology of experiments.
- Each subheading should map to one or two figures.

## Discussion discipline (concise)

- Interpret — don't recap. State what the mechanism means for the field.
- Address the **main alternative explanation** and how you exclude it.
- State **limitations** honestly (builds credibility and pre-empts reviewers).
- End on the broad significance / open question — not "more work is needed" filler.

## Length discipline tactics

- One idea per paragraph; lead with the claim.
- Move validation, controls, and orthogonal confirmations to Supplemental Information (cited as "Figure S3", "Table S1").
- Cut "In order to" → "To"; cut "It is worth noting that" and throat-clearing.
- Demote any result that doesn't serve the single arc.

## Cross-references

- Main figures: "Figure 1" (Cell spells out "Figure"); panels "Figure 1A".
- Supplemental: "Figure S1", "Table S1", "Video S1".
- STAR Methods sections are referenced by name (e.g., "see STAR Methods").

## Output format

```
【Sections present】 Summary / Intro / Results / Discussion / STAR Methods / legends / refs
【Methods format】 free-text (FIX → STAR Methods) / STAR Methods (ok)
【Main-text length】 ~N chars incl. legends → over/under ~45,000
【Display items】 N → within ~7–8? main vs Supplemental split
【Results subheadings】 claim-style + argument-ordered? yes/no
【Discussion】 interpretive (not a recap)? limitations stated? yes/no
【Next】 cell-figures
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Do not** write a free-text Methods section — Cell requires STAR Methods.
- **Do not** let the Discussion re-list the Results.
- **Do not** order Results chronologically when an argument order is clearer.
- **Do not** keep arc-irrelevant results in the main text to look comprehensive.

> Confirm exact length and item caps against current Cell Press author guidelines.
