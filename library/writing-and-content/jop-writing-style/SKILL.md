# Writing Style & Length (jop-writing-style)

JOP's binding constraint is **pages, not words**. The same paper that clears an APSR or AJPS word cap can
still overflow JOP's **35-page** (Research Article) or **10-page** (Short Article) budget — because the
count is **double-spaced, 12-point** and **includes notes, references, and exhibits**. This skill makes
the paper read for a general audience and **fit the page**, in **JOP Style Guide** form, kept anonymous.

## When to trigger

- Polishing a draft for clarity and general-interest readability
- The manuscript is over the page budget and must be cut
- Formatting references and headings to the JOP Style Guide
- A final anonymity pass before `jop-submission`

## Fit the page budget (the JOP-specific discipline)

- **Count pages, not words.** Format to JOP's spec — **double-spaced, 12-pt, one-inch margins** — and
  measure the real page count, because exhibits, footnotes, and the reference list all count.
- **Move overflow to the Online Appendix (≤ 25 pp).** Robustness, derivations, extra cases, and method
  detail belong there; the main text must still stand on its own.
- **Cut footnotes hard.** Notes count toward the limit — fold what matters into the text, drop the rest.
- **Trim the reference list to what you engage.** A bloated bibliography costs real pages.
- **For a Short Article (≤ 10 pp)**, write one argument, one clean analysis, minimal apparatus.

## Write for the general reader

- State the question, contribution, and finding in the first page — a non-specialist should grasp the
  stakes without subfield jargon.
- Define terms and acronyms on first use; avoid insider shorthand.
- Lead each section with its point; prefer short, declarative sentences over hedged paragraphs.

## JOP Style Guide & anonymity

- Follow the **JOP Style Guide** (house author-date) consistently for citations, headings, and
  references; pick one and do not mix conventions.
- Abstract **≤ 150 words** (question + approach + findings, no citations); **4–5 keywords**.
- **Double-blind**: no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or first-person self-citation in the
  anonymous file; a separate title/abstract page carries identifying details.

## Anti-patterns

- Editing to a word target and discovering the page count is over at submission
- Hiding overflow in dense single-spaced tables to "save pages" (violates the format spec)
- Subfield jargon that loses the general JOP reader
- Mixing citation styles or leaving self-identifying phrasing in the anonymous manuscript

## Where the pages actually go (page-recovery table)

When a JOP draft runs long, the recovery move depends on what is eating the count. JOP's inclusion of
notes, references, and exhibits in the page total means the cheapest cuts are often outside the body prose.

| Page sink | Recover by | Keep, do not cut |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Bloated reference list | Trim to works you engage; drop citation-padding | The few that define the debate you join |
| Heavy footnotes | Fold load-bearing notes into text; delete asides | A note carrying a real qualification |
| Full regression grids in body | Move to the Online Appendix, cite in one line | The headline specification |
| Literature survey paragraphs | Compress to the conversation and the gap | The sentence stating your delta |
| Long methods narration | Push diagnostics to the appendix | The identifying assumption in plain prose |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A hypothetical American-politics Short Article reads at 12 pages (illustrative), two over the cap. The
author resists deleting findings and instead trims the page sinks: 14 citations that signaled familiarity
without doing work are cut, four footnotes fold into the text, and a secondary subgroup plot moves to the
appendix. The argument is untouched; the draft now reads at 10 pages (illustrative), and the opening still
states question, contribution, and finding for a non-specialist on the first page.

## Referee pushback patterns and the JOP fix

- *"The writing assumes I am in your subfield."* Define terms on first use and state the general stake in
  the first paragraph; a comparativist should follow an American-politics paper and vice versa.
- *"This is over length."* Recover pages from references, notes, and exhibits before touching the argument,
  and confirm the count on the formatted double-spaced PDF, not a word processor's word count.

## Output format

```
【Category】Research Article (≤35 pp) / Short Article (≤10 pp)
【Measured length】pages at double-spaced 12-pt (incl. notes/refs/exhibits)
【Over budget?】what moves to the Online Appendix
【Abstract】≤150 words, no citations? [Y/N]  Keywords: 4–5? [Y/N]
【Style + anonymity】JOP Style Guide consistent; anonymous file clean? [Y/N]
【Next】jop-replication-and-data-policy
```
