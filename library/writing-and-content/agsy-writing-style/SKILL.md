description: "Use when drafting or polishing an Agricultural Systems (AgSy) manuscript so it reads clearly for a systems-science audience, follows the journal's format, and meets front-matter requirements (abstract <= 250 words, Highlights, graphical abstract). Research papers run to about 8,000 words (no hard cap). Tightens prose and format; it does not invent content."

# Writing Style (agsy-writing-style)

An AgSy paper must be readable by a broad **systems-science** audience — agronomists, modellers,
economists, and environmental scientists — and prepared with the journal's front matter. This skill is
about communicating a systems analysis clearly and meeting Elsevier's format, not about generating
claims.

## When to trigger

- Drafting the introduction, framing the contribution, or final polish
- Writing the **≤ 250-word abstract**, the **Highlights**, or the **graphical abstract**
- Tightening a long methods/results section toward the ~8,000-word guideline
- Aligning references and format to the journal's style before submission

## Reach the systems-science audience

1. **Front-load the systems contribution.** By the end of the introduction the reader knows the system,
   the interaction/trade-off in question, the modelling approach, and why the result matters. Don't make
   a reader dig for the "so what."
2. **Define the system early.** State boundary, components, and hierarchical level so a non-specialist
   in your exact subsystem can follow (see `agsy-systems-framing-and-modeling`).
3. **Explain the model in plain terms first**, then in detail. A reader should grasp what the model does
   before meeting its equations.
4. **Argument-first prose.** Lead with the systems insight; use model output and statistics to support
   it. Avoid "the model shows…" without saying what it shows about the system and why it matters.
5. **Signpost.** Clear IMRaD-style structure so a reader can navigate framing → model → evaluation →
   trade-offs → implications.

## Format & front matter (source map refreshed 2026-06-20)

- **Abstract**: **≤ 250 words**, stating purpose, principal results, and major conclusions.
- **Highlights**: 3-5 short bullet points, each no more than 85 characters including spaces.
- **Graphical abstract**: a separate figure file summarizing the work for an interdisciplinary audience
  — often a conceptual system diagram or a trade-off result; live-check current size/format specs.
- **References**: format to the journal's style; manage with Zotero/Mendeley/BibTeX (Elsevier
  `elsarticle` for LaTeX). 
- **Declarations**: CRediT roles, declaration of competing interest, funding, and AI-use disclosure
  where applicable (see `agsy-submission`).

## Length discipline (research paper ~8,000 words; no hard cap)

- Move full calibration tables, parameter lists, and exhaustive scenario grids to supplementary material.
- Cut throat-clearing and literature dumps; engage the systems debate, not every paper.
- Prefer one decisive trade-off figure to three redundant tables.

## Anti-patterns

- An intro that never states the systems contribution or the trade-off at stake
- An abstract over 250 words, or one that hides the result; missing Highlights / graphical abstract
- Dropping a model's equations on the reader before explaining what it does
- Describing a single factor as if it were a system; burying the interaction
- Mixed reference styles or missing declarations

## Section-by-section moves for a systems paper

Write each section to answer the question a systems referee raises there. **Title:** name the system and
the trade-off, not just the crop. **Abstract:** lead with the interaction, end on the decision (≤250
words). **Introduction:** state boundary, interaction, model, and stakes by the last paragraph.
**Methods:** plain-language model first, equations second. **Results/Discussion:** lead with the
trade-off, then tie it to the decision and match claims to uncertainty.

## Worked micro-example: tightening one abstract sentence (illustrative)

Before (buries the system): *"Simulations were run for several management options and yields compared
across scenarios."* — passive, no interaction, no trade-off, no decision.

After (systems-first): *"A whole-farm bioeconomic model shows that shifting 30% of area to a legume
intercrop raises modelled gross margin ~8% but increases nitrogen surplus ~14%, sharpening a
margin–environment trade-off advisers must weigh when targeting rotation subsidies."* — interaction,
quantified trade-off (illustrative), and decision in one sentence.

## Referee pushback on writing → the AgSy-specific fix

- *"I could not tell what the system was."* → Add a boundary-and-components sentence plus a conceptual
  diagram early; define the hierarchical level explicitly.
- *"The contribution reads as single-discipline."* → Reframe the intro around the systems debate and
  engage both the domain and modelling literatures (see `agsy-literature-positioning`).
- *"The model arrives as a wall of equations."* → Lead with plain English on what it does.

## Calibration anchors (hedged where uncertain)

- The ≤250-word abstract, Highlights, and graphical abstract are standing Elsevier front-matter
  expectations; confirm exact requirements on the current author guidelines.
- The ~8,000-word figure is a guideline, not a hard cap — judgment plus current guidance governs length.

## Output format

```
【Systems contribution stated by end of intro?】[Y/N]
【System defined early?】boundary + components + level? [Y/N]
【Abstract】word count (≤250)
【Highlights + graphical abstract】prepared? [Y/N]
【Length】near ~8,000 words; extras moved to supplementary? [Y/N]
【References + declarations】styled + CRediT/COI/funding/AI disclosure ready? [Y/N]
【Next】agsy-impact-and-implications
```
