# Writing Style (eursr-writing-style)

An ESR paper must be readable by a comparative-minded quantitative sociologist, formatted to OUP/ESR
conventions, and disciplined to a target length **that includes endnotes and references**. This skill
is about reaching ESR's audience and respecting the format — not generating claims.

## When to trigger

- Drafting the introduction, framing the contribution, or final polish
- Over the ~8,000-word target and needing to cut without losing the argument
- Writing the **≤200-word** abstract
- Aligning citations and format to OUP/ESR conventions (author-date, in English)

## Reach the comparative quantitative audience

1. **Front-load the contribution.** By the end of the introduction the reader knows the question, the
   mechanism and hypotheses, the comparative/longitudinal leverage, and what the paper changes.
2. **Lead with the mechanism, support with models.** State the macro–micro argument (from
   `eursr-theory-building`) in words first; the estimates serve it. Avoid a results-first narration.
3. **Translate the estimates.** Report what a coefficient *means* (a predicted-probability scenario, a
   marginal effect), not just its sign and stars — the reader thinks substantively.
4. **Acceptable English.** ESR considers only papers in good English; clarity and concision are the
   author's responsibility. Spell out acronyms; define harmonization schemes (ISCED/CASMIN, ISEI/EGP)
   on first use.

## Format to OUP/ESR conventions

- **Citations**: author-date, parenthetical (e.g., "(Gans, 1962)"); one consistent style (manage with
  Zotero/BibTeX). **Endnotes and references count toward the ~8,000 words.**
- **Anonymity**: no author-identifying information anywhere in the manuscript; you **may cite your own
  work** but must word it so it does not identify you ("in our prior study" → "in a prior study").
- **Abstract**: **≤200 words**, with no identifying information; keywords as requested.
- **Language**: English; figures/tables placed per OUP instructions.

## Fit the length (incl. text + endnotes + references; tables/figures excluded)

- Tighten the literature review — engage the debate, not every paper (see `eursr-literature-positioning`).
- **Endnotes and references count**, so prune redundant citations and over-long reference strings; keep
  endnotes lean.
- Move extended robustness, invariance tables, and harmonization detail to the (supplementary) appendix.
- Longer-than-8,000 papers are accepted but reviewers are asked whether the contribution justifies the
  length — make every page earn its place.

## Prose moves an ESR reader needs

| Weakness | Comparative reader experiences | Prose fix |
|----------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| Results-first narration | can't find the argument | lead with the mechanism + hypotheses |
| Stars-only interpretation | doesn't know the magnitude | translate to a predicted-probability scenario |
| Coding schemes undefined | stalls on ISCED/EGP | define harmonization on first use |
| Over-long reference strings | length burned, argument thin | prune; endnotes + references count |
| Self-citation in identifying voice | anonymity broken | "in a prior study," not "in our prior study" |

## Worked micro-example (illustrative)

A multilevel-study introduction is rewritten to reach the ESR audience.

```
Before: "We estimate random-slope models of the SES gradient in test scores across PISA waves..."
  → method-first; the reader doesn't know the argument
After: "Does early tracking widen the social gap in achievement by forcing high-stakes choices on
  families under uncertainty? We argue it shifts the gap from performance to choice..." → mechanism
  first, hypothesis visible, comparison implied
Abstract: trimmed 236 → 192 words, finding plain, no institution named → within ≤200
Length: pruned 35 redundant citations + 4 long endnotes, recovering ~700 words toward the ~8,000 target
```

The contribution leads, the method follows, and the prune is treated as a budget item.

## Referee pushback → ESR-specific fix

- *"Reads as a results report."* → Move the mechanism and hypotheses into the first two pages so the
  argument leads the estimates.
- *"What does this coefficient mean substantively?"* → Translate it into a predicted-probability or
  marginal-effect scenario the reader can picture.
- *"Over length."* → Tighten literature engagement, prune citation strings and endnotes; references and
  endnotes count, tables and figures do not.

## Calibration anchors

- **Write for the comparative quantitative reader.** ESR's reader thinks in mechanisms and magnitudes —
  lead with the argument and translate the estimates.
- **Endnotes and references are inside the target.** ESR counts them toward ~8,000 words — budget
  citations from the first draft.
- **Confirm length/abstract specifics against the current OUP guidelines** if exact limits are
  decision-relevant; the broad shape (~8,000; ≤200-word abstract) is stable.

## Anti-patterns

- A method-first or results-first intro that never states the mechanism or comparative stakes
- Reporting estimates as stars without substantive translation
- An abstract over 200 words or one that hides the finding
- Self-references worded so they break anonymity
- Treating endnotes and references as "free" — they count toward ~8,000 words

## Output format

```
【Contribution stated by end of intro?】[Y/N]
【Mechanism-first, estimates translated?】[Y/N]
【Abstract】word count (≤200), non-identifying?
【Word count】Article ~8,000 incl. text + endnotes + references? (longer justified?)
【OUP style + anonymous + author-date】[Y/N]
【Next】eursr-transparency-and-data
```
