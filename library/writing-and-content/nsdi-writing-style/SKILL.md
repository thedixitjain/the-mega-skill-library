# NSDI Writing Style

An NSDI paper argues that a nameable design idea, embodied in a working networked
system, holds up under realistic traffic. The prose exists to make that chain
checkable. Format facts below are the NSDI '27 CFP as rendered on 2026-07-08.

## The opening arc

NSDI first pages that work tend to execute five beats in order (see the rebuilt
example in
[`../../resources/worked-examples/01-introduction.md`](../../resources/worked-examples/01-introduction.md)):

1. **Operational pain, evidenced** — a failure shape, cost, or limit shown in a trace
   or deployment, not asserted from intuition.
2. **Why the networked setting causes it** — the distributed or stack-level reason
   local fixes fail. This beat is also the scope defense; a paper that cannot write it
   is drifting out of the CFP's "design of networked systems or the networking stack."
3. **The design principle, named** — the transferable idea, stated so another team
   could apply it to a different system.
4. **The built system** — what was implemented, where it runs, what was not built.
5. **Claims with evidence addresses** — each headline number tied to a section, a
   workload, and a percentile.

## Budget arithmetic before sentence polish

The '27 rule: **12 pages including footnotes, figures, and tables; references and
appendices may extend beyond**. Two consequences shape the writing:

- Figures are inside the cap, so every plot pays rent. Cut the third bar chart saying
  "ours is faster again"; keep the breakdown that explains *why*.
- Appendices exist but are overflow, not annex: reviewers judge the 12 pages. Nothing
  load-bearing (a baseline, the key workload description, a correctness argument)
  may live only past the references (`nsdi-supplementary`).

A workable allocation for a 12-page systems paper:

| Section | Pages | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Intro + motivation measurement | 2 - 2.5 | Beats 1-3 with data |
| Design | 3 - 3.5 | Principle → mechanism → interfaces; failure handling explicit |
| Implementation | 0.5 - 1 | What exists, LoC/frameworks, honest deltas from design |
| Evaluation | 3.5 - 4 | Questions answered, not benchmarks toured |
| Related work + discussion | 1 - 1.5 | Positioning + stated limits |

## Sentence-level calibration

Systems reviewers at this venue distrust superlatives and read distributions. Editing
passes that consistently improve NSDI drafts:

- Replace every "up to N×" with the percentile, workload, and range: "2.1-3.4× at
  p99.9 on the replayed incident weeks."
- Replace "significantly / dramatically / novel" with the measured delta or the named
  mechanism. Adjectives signal missing numbers.
- Convert passive mechanism descriptions into agent-explicit ones — *which component
  decides, on what signal, at what timescale*.
- State the boundary honestly, in the body: the regime where the design loses
  (incast, single replica, cold caches). NSDI culture treats a named limitation as
  competence, and an unnamed one found by a reviewer as concealment.
- Keep terminology bijective: one name per component, one component per name, figures
  and text agreeing exactly.

```text
Weak:  "Our novel scheduler significantly reduces latency (up to 4.1x)
        compared to state-of-the-art approaches."
NSDI:  "Shifting retries off congested paths cuts p99.9 latency 2.1-3.4x
        vs tuned exponential backoff across the three incident classes
        (§6.2); gains vanish when RTT < the lease renewal interval (§7)."
```

## Anonymity constraints on prose

Double-blind shapes phrasing, with one NSDI-specific fork: research-track papers
neutralize identifying deployment details ("a large provider's fleet"), while
**operational-track papers may keep real system and company names** with author names
still withheld. Write self-citations in the third person; never delete a reference to
hide identity; cite a concurrent NSDI submission as "Under submission. Details omitted
for double-blind reviewing." The CFP endorses AI tools for grammar and clarity of
human-written text — the ideas, and the responsibility, stay human.

## Revision-letter prose (one-shot resubmissions)

A resubmitted revision is read by the same reviewers against their own issue list, so
the writing task inverts: instead of impressing a stranger, show a known reader that
each demanded change exists. Keep new text visually traceable — the auxiliary
change-highlighted PDF must let a reviewer jump from issue to fix in seconds
(`nsdi-author-response`). Prose that quietly rewrites unrelated sections invites
re-litigation of settled points.

## Figures as argument, not decoration

Because figures bill against the 12 pages, each one should be designed like a
paragraph with a topic sentence:

- Caption states the takeaway ("Leases cap retry amplification at 1.3× during all
  three incident classes"), not the axes ("Latency vs. time").
- One visual idea per figure; a plot needing three sentences of legend explanation
  is two plots or zero.
- CDFs for distribution claims, timelines for dynamic behavior, breakdowns for
  "why" claims — the form should match the claim type (`nsdi-experiments`).
- Readability at print scale: systems reviewers annotate paper printouts; 6-point
  axis labels get skipped, and a skipped figure is a page of rent paid for nothing.

## Self-edit checklist

- [ ] First page executes all five beats; a stranger can quote the design principle.
- [ ] Every claim has an evidence address (section + workload + metric).
- [ ] No superlative survives without a number; tails reported where tails matter.
- [ ] Failure regimes named in the body, not confessed in the appendix.
- [ ] 12-page count verified on the built PDF, figures included.
- [ ] Anonymization style matches the declared track.

## Output format

```text
[Arc check] beats 1-5 present? weakest beat + fix
[Budget] pages by section vs allocation; what to cut first
[Calibration] list of unbacked superlatives / missing percentiles
[Boundary] named failure regimes: <list or MISSING>
[Track-consistent anonymity] research-neutralized / operational-named
[Edit order] highest-leverage rewrite first
```
