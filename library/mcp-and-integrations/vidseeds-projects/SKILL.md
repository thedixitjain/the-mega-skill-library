# Projects (MCP)

A **project** is the workspace for one video across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X.

## Discover projects

- `vidseeds_list_projects` - browse with limits/filters per tool schema.
- `vidseeds_get_project` - single project record.
- `vidseeds_get_project_snapshot` - project + platform config in one call (prefer over many gets).

## Create from YouTube

1. `vidseeds_create_project_from_youtube` with the YouTube video id/URL (see tool inputs).
2. If metadata generation is async, poll `vidseeds_get_create_project_metadata_job` until `completed`.
3. Confirm with `vidseeds_get_project_snapshot`.

## Regenerate platform metadata

Re-runs optimized titles/descriptions/tags per platform from the stored transcript.

| Mode         | Tool                                           | Notes                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Fast / small | `vidseeds_regenerate_project_metadata`         | Can exceed ~100s edge timeout on large projects |
| Production   | `vidseeds_regenerate_project_metadata_async`   | Returns `jobId` immediately                     |
| Poll         | `vidseeds_get_regenerate_project_metadata_job` | Same result shape as sync when done             |

Pass `focus: "titles"` (with regenerate) to use the lightweight titles-only generator (still 1 seed, but far less AI work than full variants).

**Voice:** If the user has multiple YouTube channels, pass `channelId` (`UC…`). With one connection, omit for auto-resolve. `voiceBlendRatio` optional (tool default documented in `tools/list`).

Reuse the same `requestId` on transport retries to avoid double seed charges when the tool allows it.

Keep create, regenerate, and targeted field-refresh calls for the same video close together when possible. VidSeeds.ai reuses recent per-video analysis context for about an hour during a metadata workflow, so follow-up quality checks and regenerations are usually cheaper and faster when they stay in the same project flow.

**Targeted / cheap regen (2026-06):** Use `fields: ["description", "tags"]` (or include "title") on regenerate/optimize for light per-field generators (correct lower AI cost for the work, while the action still uses the reoptimize 1-seed price). For thumbnails or edits, use the dedicated thumbnail tools (pricing is per-image with model; edits that reference an input image cost more than pure generation).

## Optimize metadata without a full project (standalone)

- `vidseeds_optimize_marketing_metadata` / `vidseeds_optimize_marketing_metadata_async` - needs transcript (e.g. from `vidseeds_transcribe_audio` or YouTube transcript tools).
- Poll: `vidseeds_get_optimize_marketing_metadata_job`.
- Pass `focus: "titles"` for title-only (light generator, 1 seed).

## Suggest titles only (light 1-seed path for "new titles" requests)

- `vidseeds_suggest_titles` - dedicated tool for title suggestions only. 1 seed. Accepts `projectId` (loads transcript/meaning) or direct `transcript`. Much lower AI cost than full optimize/regenerate. Use this (or regenerate+focus=titles) instead of create_new when user asks for title options. Idempotent with key.

## Translate project metadata

- `vidseeds_translate_project_metadata` - localization across supported languages (no voice dubbing on VidSeeds.ai).

## Thumbnail on project

- Generate per `vidseeds-thumbnails`, then `vidseeds_apply_thumbnail_to_project`.

## Per-platform publish config

- `vidseeds_update_project_platform_config` - enable platform, title/description/tags, schedule, connection, thumbnail URL override.

## Publish

After config is ready, use `vidseeds-publishing` (`vidseeds_preflight_publish` → `vidseeds_confirm_publish` / `vidseeds_publish_project`).

## History

- `vidseeds_list_optimization_history`, `vidseeds_get_optimization_history_item`, `vidseeds_reoptimize_history_item` - past runs and re-run from history.
