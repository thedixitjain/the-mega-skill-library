# kachilu-browser

Browser automation CLI for AI agents. Chrome/Chromium via CDP with
accessibility-tree snapshots and compact `@eN` element refs.

Install: `npm i -g kachilu-browser && kachilu-browser install`

## Start Here

This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide. Before running any
`kachilu-browser` command, load the actual workflow content from the CLI:

```bash
kachilu-browser skills get core             # start here: workflows, control-plane routing, CAPTCHA, troubleshooting
kachilu-browser skills get core --full      # include references and templates when needed
```

The CLI serves skill content that matches the installed version, so instructions
do not drift when the package is upgraded. The core guide contains the Kachilu
human-like interaction defaults, control-plane routing rules, rich composer safeguards,
CAPTCHA workflow, and the command reference.

If the host already provides a pre-attached browser session, CDP endpoint,
session ref file, or explicit `kachilu-browser --session ... --cdp ...` command,
use that host-provided session through the CLI. Do not switch to MCP
`prepare_workspace` or auto-connect unless the core guide says that no
host-provided session is available.

For MCP hosts such as OpenClaw, keep using the same prepared workspace session
across related browser work in one user request, even when moving between sites
such as LinkedIn and X. The `site` hint is for routing only. Do not close the
workspace between those steps unless the user explicitly wants cleanup. If the
daemon still exists but the browser connection is gone, treat that workspace as
stale and reconnect instead of reusing it.

## Critical Fallback

If an element-targeted click fails but the visible cursor is already on the
intended button or control, take a screenshot/capture and confirm the cursor is
on target. Then click at the current cursor position:

```bash
kachilu-browser mouse down left
kachilu-browser mouse up left
kachilu-browser snapshot -i
```

Use this after visual confirmation instead of repeating the same failing ref or
locator click.
