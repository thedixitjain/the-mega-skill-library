# Peer Review

Use a second AI agent to review and challenge the first agent's work. The peer reviewer exists to find
what the builder missed -- not to agree, not to be polite, and not to rubber-stamp. This is the
single most effective quality gate you can add beyond automated tests.

## Core Principle

> **The peer reviewer's job is to find what the builder missed, not to agree.**

A review that says "looks good" is a wasted review. The peer review model should be given explicit
instructions to be critical, to challenge assumptions, and to look for what is *not* there rather
than what is.

---

## Why Peer Review Works

LLMs have blind spots. Every model has patterns it over-relies on, edge cases it misses, and
architectural assumptions it makes implicitly. A second model -- or the same model with a different
prompt and role -- catches a different set of issues.

**The analogy:** In traditional engineering, code review exists because the author has cognitive
blind spots about their own work. The same principle applies to AI agents, but the blind spots are
different: they are systematic patterns in training data, context window limitations, and prompt
interpretation biases.

**What peer review catches that automated tests miss:**
- Architectural over-engineering or under-engineering
- Missing error handling patterns
- Security vulnerabilities the builder didn't consider
- Cavekit requirements that were technically met but poorly implemented
- Dead code, unused imports, and unnecessary complexity
- Performance pitfalls that only manifest at scale
- Missing edge cases not covered by the cavekit

---

## Review Modes

| Mode | Timing | Mechanism |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Diff Critique** | After implementation completes | A second model inspects the changeset with a fault-finding prompt; the builder incorporates valid fixes |
| **Design Challenge** | During the planning phase | A second model proposes alternative designs; the builder evaluates both against spec requirements and selects the stronger option |
| **Threaded Debate** | When exploring complex trade-offs | Multiple exchanges occur on a persistent conversation thread so context accumulates across turns |
| **Delegated Scrutiny** | For substantial review tasks | A dedicated teammate agent manages the full peer review interaction and delivers a consolidated findings report to the lead |
| **Deciding Vote** | When two approaches conflict | The lead presents both options to the peer review model, which analyzes trade-offs and recommends a path forward |
| **Coverage Audit** | During the validation phase | Test coverage data and gap analysis are fed to the peer review model for independent assessment of testing thoroughness |

### Choosing the Right Mode

```
Need peer review
├─ Reviewing completed code?
│   ├─ Small changeset (< 500 lines) → Diff Critique
│   └─ Large changeset or full feature → Delegated Scrutiny
├─ Designing architecture?
│   ├─ Single decision point → Deciding Vote
│   └─ Full system design → Design Challenge
├─ Debating trade-offs?
│   ├─ Need extended back-and-forth → Threaded Debate
│   └─ Need a decisive answer → Deciding Vote
└─ Validating test quality?
    └─ Coverage Audit
```

## Setting Up Peer Review via MCP Server

Any AI model that exposes an MCP server interface can serve as an peer reviewer. The setup
is model-agnostic -- the pattern works with any model that supports the MCP protocol.

### Generic MCP Configuration

Add the peer review model as an MCP server in your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peer reviewer": {
      "command": "{ADVERSARY_CLI}",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "{ADVERSARY_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `{ADVERSARY_CLI}` with the CLI command for your chosen model (e.g., any model's CLI tool
that supports MCP server mode) and `{ADVERSARY_API_KEY}` with the appropriate credentials.

### Two Core MCP Tools

Most peer review model MCP servers expose two tools:

1. **Start session** -- Begin a new conversation with the peer review model
   - Parameters: prompt, approval policy, sandbox mode, model selection
   - Returns: a thread/session identifier

2. **Reply to session** -- Continue an existing conversation
   - Parameters: thread/session ID, follow-up message
   - Returns: the model's response

The thread/session identifier is critical -- it allows multi-turn conversations where the peer reviewer
builds on previous context.

### Example: Starting an Peer Review Session

```
Tool: peer reviewer.start_session
Parameters:
  prompt: "Review the following code changes for bugs, security issues,
           missing edge cases, and spec compliance. Be critical -- your
           job is to find problems, not to agree. Here are the changes:
           {DIFF_CONTENT}"
  model: "{ADVERSARY_MODEL}"
```

### Example: Multi-Turn Follow-Up

```
Tool: peer reviewer.reply_to_session
Parameters:
  thread_id: "{THREAD_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS}"
  message: "Good findings. Now focus specifically on error handling paths.
            For each function that can fail, verify there is explicit
            error handling and that errors propagate correctly."
```

## Strategy Details

### 1. Diff Critique

**When:** After a builder agent completes implementation of a feature or fix.

**Process:**
1. Builder agent implements the feature and commits
2. Generate a diff of all changes: `git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD`
3. Send the diff to the peer review model with a code review prompt
4. Parse the peer reviewer's findings into actionable items
5. Builder agent applies fixes for valid findings
6. Optionally: send fixes back to peer reviewer for re-review

**Review Prompt Template:**
```markdown
You are a senior code reviewer. Review the following code changes critically.

## What to look for:
- Bugs, logic errors, off-by-one errors
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, data exposure)
- Missing error handling and edge cases
- Performance issues (N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, blocking calls)
- Cavekit compliance: does this implementation match the requirements?
- Code quality: naming, structure, unnecessary complexity

## What NOT to do:
- Do not say "looks good" unless you genuinely found zero issues
- Do not suggest stylistic changes unless they affect readability significantly
- Do not rewrite the code -- describe the problem and where it is

## Cavekit requirements for this feature:
{CAVEKIT_REQUIREMENTS}

## Code changes:
{DIFF_CONTENT}

## Output format:
For each finding:
- **Severity:** CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- **File:** path and line range
- **Issue:** what is wrong
- **Why:** why this matters
- **Suggestion:** how to fix it
```

### 2. Design Challenge

**When:** During the planning phase, before implementation begins.

**Process:**
1. Builder agent drafts an architecture or plan
2. Send the plan + kits to the peer review model
3. Peer reviewer proposes alternative approaches or critiques the plan
4. Builder validates both approaches against kits
5. Human makes the final decision if there is a genuine trade-off

**Architecture Review Prompt Template:**
```markdown
You are a systems architect reviewing a proposed design. Your goal is to
find weaknesses, over-engineering, missing considerations, and better
alternatives.

## Kits (what must be built):
{CAVEKIT_CONTENT}

## Proposed architecture:
{PLAN_CONTENT}

## Evaluate:
1. Does this architecture satisfy all cavekit requirements?
2. Is it over-engineered for the scope?
3. Are there simpler alternatives that meet the same requirements?
4. What failure modes exist? How does the system recover?
5. What are the scaling bottlenecks?
6. What dependencies introduce risk?
```

### 3. Threaded Debate

**When:** Complex design discussions that require extended back-and-forth.

**Process:**
1. Start a session with the peer review model presenting the problem
2. Use reply-to-session to continue the conversation across multiple turns
3. Maintain the thread ID throughout the discussion
4. Summarize conclusions when the discussion converges

**Key consideration:** Thread-based conversations accumulate context. Keep the
conversation focused on a single topic to avoid context dilution.

### 4. Delegated Scrutiny

**When:** Large tasks where the peer review itself is substantial.

**Process:**
1. Team lead spawns a teammate specifically for peer review coordination
2. The teammate owns the peer reviewer MCP interaction
3. Teammate manages multi-turn review sessions
4. Teammate summarizes findings and reports to the team lead
5. Team lead assigns fixes to the appropriate builder teammates

**Why delegate:** The peer review back-and-forth can consume significant context
window. Delegating it to a dedicated teammate preserves the team lead's context
for coordination.

### 5. Deciding Vote

**When:** The builder agent and human (or two agents) disagree on an approach.

**Process:**
1. Present both perspectives to the peer review model
2. Ask it to evaluate the trade-offs of each approach
3. Ask it to recommend one, with explicit reasoning
4. Use the recommendation to inform the decision (human has final say)

**Tie-Breaking Prompt Template:**
```markdown
Two approaches have been proposed for the same problem. Evaluate both
critically and recommend one.

## Context:
{PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION}

## Approach A:
{APPROACH_A}

## Approach B:
{APPROACH_B}

## Evaluation criteria:
- Correctness: which approach is more likely to be correct?
- Simplicity: which is easier to understand and maintain?
- Performance: which performs better for the expected use case?
- Risk: which has fewer failure modes?

## Your recommendation:
Pick one and explain why. If neither is clearly better, say so and
explain what additional information would break the tie.
```

### 6. Coverage Audit

**When:** During validation, after tests have been generated and run.

**Process:**
1. Run test coverage analysis on the codebase
2. Generate a coverage report (which files/functions are covered)
3. Send the coverage report + kits to the peer review model
4. Peer reviewer identifies: untested edge cases, missing integration tests,
   cavekit requirements without corresponding tests
5. Builder adds missing tests

---

## Peer Review Iteration (Convergence Loop with Review)

Instead of a simple build-then-review, run alternating convergence loops where each
iteration alternates between building and reviewing.

### The Pattern

```
Iteration 1: Builder runs against spec → produces code
Iteration 2: Reviewer runs against code + spec → produces findings
Iteration 3: Builder runs against spec + findings → fixes code
Iteration 4: Reviewer runs against updated code + spec → produces new findings
...repeat until findings converge to zero (or trivial)
```

### Implementation with Separate Prompts

Create two prompt files:

**`prompts/build.md`** -- The builder prompt:
```markdown
Implement the requirements in the cavekit. Read implementation tracking for
context on what has been done. Read any review findings and address them.

Input: kits/, plans/, impl/, review-findings.md (if exists)
Output: source code, updated impl tracking
Exit: all cavekit requirements implemented, all review findings addressed
```

**`prompts/review.md`** -- The reviewer prompt:
```markdown
Review the current implementation against the cavekit. Be critical. Find
bugs, missing requirements, security issues, and quality problems.

Input: kits/, plans/, source code, impl/
Output: review-findings.md
Exit: all source files reviewed against all cavekit requirements
```

### Running Peer Review Iteration

```bash
# Terminal 1: Builder convergence loop
{LOOP_TOOL} prompts/build.md -n 5 -t 2h

# Terminal 2: Reviewer convergence loop (staggered by 30 min)
{LOOP_TOOL} prompts/review.md -n 5 -t 2h -d 30m
```

The builder and reviewer share the same git repository. The reviewer reads the
builder's latest committed code; the builder reads the reviewer's latest
`review-findings.md`. They converge naturally through git.

### Convergence Signal

The peer review loop has converged when:
- The reviewer's findings drop to zero or only LOW severity items remain
- The builder's diffs between iterations are minimal
- All cavekit requirements have been reviewed and confirmed as met

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Peer reviewer as Yes-Man
**Problem:** The peer review model says "looks good" without finding real issues.
**Fix:** Explicitly instruct the peer reviewer to find problems. Add to the prompt:
"If you find zero issues, explain what areas you checked and why you believe
they are correct. An empty review is suspicious."

### 2. Peer reviewer Rewrites Everything
**Problem:** The peer reviewer provides complete rewrites instead of identifying issues.
**Fix:** Instruct the peer reviewer to describe problems and locations, not to write
code. "Your output is a list of findings, not a pull request."

### 3. Builder Ignores Findings
**Problem:** The builder agent dismisses peer reviewer findings without addressing them.
**Fix:** Require the builder to explicitly respond to each finding: "For each
review finding, either fix it and explain the fix, or explain why the finding
is not valid. You may not skip any finding."

### 4. Infinite Disagreement Loop
**Problem:** Builder and reviewer keep going back and forth without converging.
**Fix:** Set a maximum iteration count. After N iterations, escalate to human.
If the disagreement persists, it likely indicates an ambiguous spec that needs
human clarification.

### 5. Same Model Reviewing Itself
**Problem:** Using the same model with the same prompt for both building and reviewing.
**Fix:** At minimum, use different prompts with different roles. Ideally, use a
different model or a different model version. The value of peer review comes
from diverse perspectives.

## Prompt Templates Quick Reference

| Mode | Key Prompt Instruction |
|------|----------------------|
| Diff Critique | "Find bugs, security issues, missing edge cases. Do not say 'looks good'." |
| Design Challenge | "Find weaknesses and simpler alternatives. Evaluate failure modes." |
| Threaded Debate | "Continue the discussion. Build on previous context." |
| Delegated Scrutiny | "Own the peer reviewer interaction. Summarize findings for the lead." |
| Deciding Vote | "Evaluate both approaches. Recommend one with explicit reasoning." |
| Coverage Audit | "Identify untested edge cases and spec requirements without tests." |

## Integration with Cavekit Lifecycle

Peer review fits into the Hunt lifecycle at multiple points:

| Hunt Phase | Peer Review Role |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Draft** | Review kits for completeness, ambiguity, missing edge cases |
| **Architect** | Architecture Review: challenge the plan before implementation begins |
| **Build** | Code Review: review implementation against kits after each feature |
| **Inspect** | Peer Review iteration loop: alternate build/review convergence |
| **Monitor** | Test Coverage Review: validate that monitoring covers all failure modes |

The most impactful point is during **Inspect** -- peer review iteration catches issues
that neither automated tests nor single-agent convergence loops find.

## Codex Loop Mode — Cavekit + Ralph Loop + Codex Peer Reviewer

The most rigorous automated quality process available: run a Cavekit cavekit through a Ralph Loop where Claude builds and Codex adversarially reviews every few iterations. A completely different model (different training data, different biases, different blind spots) challenges your implementation.

### Why This Works

| Factor | Single-Model Loop | Codex Loop Mode |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Blind spots | Same model, same blind spots every iteration | Two models catch different classes of issues |
| Cavekit drift | Builder may silently deviate from cavekit | Peer reviewer checks cavekit compliance explicitly |
| Quality floor | Converges to "good enough for one model" | Converges to "survives cross-examination" |
| Dead ends | May retry failed approaches | Peer reviewer flags repeated patterns |

### Architecture

```

### Review Invocation: Codex CLI (primary) vs MCP (legacy)

1. **Codex CLI delegation (primary)** — `scripts/codex-review.sh` calls `codex` directly in `--approval-mode full-auto` with a structured review prompt. Faster, no MCP server overhead. Findings parsed and appended to `context/impl/impl-review-findings.md`.
2. **MCP server (legacy fallback)** — Codex configured as an MCP server in `.mcp.json`. Claude calls the MCP tool on review iterations. Used only when Codex CLI delegation is unavailable.

`setup-build.sh` auto-detects: if `codex-review.sh` is present and `codex` CLI is available, CLI delegation is used. Otherwise, falls back to MCP configuration.

### Activation

```bash
/ck:make --peer-review                       # activates Codex Loop Mode (default interval: every 2nd iteration)
/ck:make --peer-review --review-interval 1   # review every iteration (maximum rigor)
/ck:make --peer-review --codex-model gpt-5.4-mini   # faster, cheaper reviewer
```

### What `--peer-review` Does

1. **Validates** Codex CLI is installed (or MCP fallback is configured).
2. **Configures** Codex as an MCP server in `.mcp.json` if CLI delegation is unavailable.
3. **Builds** a Ralph Loop prompt that embeds:
   - The cavekit path and related plan/impl files.
   - Instructions to alternate between build and review iterations.
   - The peer review prompt template for Codex.
   - Completion criteria tied to cavekit acceptance criteria.
4. **Starts** the Ralph Loop via the stop hook mechanism.

### Codex CLI Invocation (what runs on review iterations)

```bash
source scripts/codex-review.sh
bp_codex_review --base main
```

The CLI path produces structured findings with severity levels (P0–P3) and handles fallback gracefully if Codex is unavailable.

### MCP Fallback Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codex-reviewer": {
      "command": "codex",
      "args": ["mcp-server", "-c", "model=\"gpt-5.4\""]
    }
  }
}
```

### Iteration Pattern

```
Iteration 1: BUILD  — Read cavekit, implement first requirement
Iteration 2: REVIEW — Call Codex CLI (or MCP fallback), get findings, fix CRITICAL/HIGH
Iteration 3: BUILD  — Continue implementing, address remaining findings
Iteration 4: REVIEW — Call Codex CLI again, new findings on new code
...
Iteration N: BUILD  — All requirements met, all findings fixed
             → outputs <promise>CAVEKIT COMPLETE</promise>
```

Default review interval: every 2nd iteration. `--review-interval 1` = review every iteration.

### Peer Review Findings File

Review findings tracked in `context/impl/impl-review-findings.md`:

```markdown
# Peer Review Findings

## Latest Review: Iteration 4 — 2026-03-14T10:30:00Z
### Reviewer: Codex (gpt-5.4)

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Status |
|---|----------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | src/auth.ts:L42 | Missing input validation on token | FIXED |
| 2 | HIGH | src/auth.ts:L67 | Race condition in session refresh | FIXED |
| 3 | MEDIUM | src/auth.ts:L15 | Unused import | NEW |
| 4 | LOW | src/auth.ts:L3 | Comment typo | WONTFIX |

## History
### Iteration 2
| # | Severity | File | Issue | Status |
|---|----------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | src/auth.ts:L20 | SQL injection in login query | FIXED |
```

### Completion Criteria (Codex Loop Mode)

The loop exits when the completion promise is output. The prompt instructs Claude to ONLY output it when ALL of these are true:

- All cavekit requirements (R-numbers) have been implemented.
- All acceptance criteria pass.
- No CRITICAL or HIGH peer review findings remain unfixed.
- Build passes.
- Tests pass.
- At least one review iteration completed with no new CRITICAL/HIGH findings.

### Review-Only Mode

For reviewing existing code against a cavekit without building:

```bash
/ck:review --codex     # single Codex-only review (see /ck:review command)
```

Each iteration calls Codex to review existing code against the cavekit, then fixes issues found.

### Prerequisites (Codex Loop Mode)

1. **Codex CLI installed:** `npm install -g @openai/codex`
2. **OpenAI API key configured:** Codex needs authentication (via `codex login` or env var).
3. **Cavekit context directory:** Cavekit file must exist at the given path.

### Convergence Signals (Codex Loop Mode)

The peer review loop has converged when:
- Codex's findings drop to zero or only LOW/MEDIUM severity.
- Code diffs between iterations are minimal.
- All cavekit requirements confirmed as met by both Claude and Codex.

If the loop hits max iterations without converging:
- Check `context/impl/impl-review-findings.md` for persistent issues.
- Consider whether the cavekit needs clarification.
- Run `/ck:revise --trace` to trace issues back to kits.
