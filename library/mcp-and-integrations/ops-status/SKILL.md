# OPS ► STATUS

Compact health panel for every configured integration. Much lighter than `/ops:go` — **no gathering, no actions, no heavy API probes.** Each row is tagged with `✓` (ok) / `○` (not configured) / `✗` (missing) / `─` (category unused).

## Runtime Context

Before rendering, load:

1. **Preferences**: `cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/preferences.json` — determines which integrations are configured
2. **Daemon health**: `cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR}/daemon-health.json` — tells the panel whether the daemon row should show `✓ running` or `○ not running`

Both are consumed by the `bin/ops-status` script internally — this skill does not parse them itself.

## CLI/API Reference

### bin/ops-status

| Command | Usage | Output |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-status` | Render the pretty text panel | ASCII panel with one row per category |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-status --json` | Machine-readable output | Flat JSON: `{clis, channels, mcps, commerce, voice, monitoring, daemon, registry, generated_at}` |

Each integration resolves to one of four status strings:

| Status | Meaning | Rendered as |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `ok` | Installed / credentialed / running | `✓` |
| `not-configured` | Known slot, no credential recorded | `○` |
| `missing` | Required but not resolvable | `✗` |
| `skipped` | User explicitly opted out via `/ops:setup` | `○` |

The script is designed to run in **under 1 second** with no network calls.

---

## What this skill does

1. Run the status script and print its output verbatim:

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-status $ARGUMENTS
```

2. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--json`, pass it through — the script emits machine-readable JSON instead of the pretty panel.

3. **Do NOT** probe any integration beyond what the script already did. **Do NOT** spawn a doctor / fix agent. **Do NOT** run API calls. If the user wants deeper checks, point them at:
   - `/ops:doctor` — full health check + auto-repair
   - `/ops:go` — full morning briefing with live data

## When to use this vs other skills

| If you want... | Use |
|----------------|-----|
| A quick "is everything connected?" glance | `/ops:status` |
| The full morning briefing with real data | `/ops:go` |
| Deep diagnostics + auto-repair | `/ops:doctor` |
| An interactive dashboard with hotkeys | `/ops:dash` |
