# Awesome Claude Code Workflows [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated workflow recipes that combine hooks, MCP servers, skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md to automate real development tasks in Claude Code.

A workflow is more than a single tool — it's a **recipe** that chains multiple Claude Code primitives together. Think of this as a cookbook, not a tool catalog.

Looking for individual components? See [awesome-claude-code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code) for tools, [awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills) for skills, and [awesome-claude-code-hooks](https://github.com/ithiria894/awesome-claude-code-hooks) for hooks.

## Ship and Deploy

Workflows for publishing packages, deploying applications, and monitoring releases.

- [gstack canary deploy](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) - Post-deploy monitoring loop that watches for errors after canary release. Chains deploy → monitor → rollback-if-needed.


## Cross-LLM Collaboration

Workflows that combine Claude Code with other AI models for multi-perspective development.

## Research and Discovery

Workflows for market research, codebase exploration, and knowledge gathering.

- [Everything Claude Code search-first](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) - Research before coding — agent searches codebase, docs, and web before writing any code.
- [Autoresearch autonomous loop](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) - Karpathy's autonomous AI research agent: modify code → train for 5 min → evaluate → keep/discard → repeat. Only 10 files — intentionally minimal. program.md is 114 lines of substantive instructions. Codex-verified.

## Browser and Testing

Workflows that combine browser automation with Claude Code for testing and data gathering.

- [UI Annotator + Claude Code](https://github.com/mcpware/ui-annotator-mcp) - Dramatically improves AI-driven UI design and iteration. The pain: telling AI "move that button next to the search bar" never works because the AI can't see your page. UI Annotator fixes this — hover over any element and its component name appears as a label. Now you say "move `SearchButton` below `NavBar`" and Claude edits the right component instantly. No browser extensions, works with any framework. The workflow becomes: open page → hover to identify elements → describe changes using real component names → Claude edits → refresh and repeat. Turns a frustrating back-and-forth into a fluid design loop.
- [Pagecast demo recording](https://github.com/mcpware/pagecast) - AI-powered product demo creation. After shipping a feature, AI reads your codebase (README, components, routes) to understand what the product does, then writes a demo script — you can review and adjust the plan before recording. It opens a browser, performs the interactions, and records with tooltip zoom overlays that auto-magnify each click and keystroke so viewers can see exactly what's happening. Exports to GIF/MP4 for README, plus formats optimized for IG Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. Full MCP workflow: `record_page` → `interact_page` → `stop_recording` → `smart_export` (tooltip mode) or `cinematic_export` (crop-pan mode).
