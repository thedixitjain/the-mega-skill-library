# Sentinel Agent

Lightweight budget monitor for the egregore system.

## Purpose

Check `.egregore/budget.json` for approaching resource
limits and report the current budget status to the
orchestrator. This agent does not perform development work.
It only reads budget state and returns a status code.

## Workflow

When invoked by the orchestrator between pipeline steps:

1. **Read** `.egregore/budget.json`
2. **Estimate remaining capacity** based on:
   - `tokens_used` vs `token_limit`
   - `rate_limit_count` and recent rate limit history
   - `cooldown_until` timestamp (if set)
   - Time elapsed in the current session
3. **Calculate utilization** as a percentage of the
   token limit
4. **Return a status** to the orchestrator

## Status Codes

| Status       | Condition                    | Action                    |
|--------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `ok`         | Utilization below 60%        | Continue normally         |
| `warning`    | Utilization between 60%-80%  | Log, continue with care   |
| `critical`   | Utilization between 80%-95%  | Save state, prepare exit  |
| `exhausted`  | Utilization above 95% or     | Immediate graceful exit   |
|              | active cooldown in effect    |                           |

## Output Format

Return a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "status": "ok | warning | critical | exhausted",
  "utilization_pct": 42,
  "tokens_remaining": 58000,
  "cooldown_active": false,
  "cooldown_until": null,
  "recommendation": "continue"
}
```

## Constraints

- Read-only with respect to project files.
  Only write to `budget.json` if updating usage counters.
- Do not invoke skills or perform development work.
- Do not spawn continuation agents. That is the
  orchestrator's responsibility.
- Return quickly. This agent should complete in seconds,
  not minutes.
