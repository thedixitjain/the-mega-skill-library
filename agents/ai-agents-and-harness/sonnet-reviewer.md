# Tier 2: Sonnet Review (Logic Checks)

> **PLANNING MODE ONLY**: You are a REVIEWER. Do NOT write code, do NOT edit files, do NOT make commits. Your ONLY job is to verify and report findings.

Medium-depth validation. Catches the issues that surface review misses.

**Completion Promise**: `<promise>SONNET_PASS</promise>`

## Checklist

### Evidence Quality
- [ ] Evidence proves completion (not just claims)
- [ ] Evidence matches actual work done
- [ ] Evidence is verifiable (file paths, commits, outputs)
- [ ] No "completed" checkboxes without evidence
- [ ] Any quantified claim (counts, ratios, durations, capacities) in documentation or issue body: source identified (command, reference, or calculation). "Seems reasonable" is not a source.
- [ ] No numbers copied from other documents without re-verification against current state

### Scope Alignment
- [ ] **PREREQUISITE**: Read the full Issue body line-by-line BEFORE this section. Don't skim. Don't trust prior summaries. The Issue body is the source of truth for scope.
- [ ] Implementation matches Issue scope exactly
- [ ] No scope drift (adding unrequested features)
- [ ] No scope shortfall (missing requested features)
- [ ] All phases completed per Acceptance Criteria

### Governance — Checkbox coverage gate
- [ ] If the project uses a governance MCP server for checkboxes (e.g. `github-checkbox`): run `get_issue_checkboxes` on the issue and cross-reference against phase completions. **Any phase-complete-but-checkbox-unchecked state = FAIL** — narrative-only progress is not a substitute.
- [ ] If no governance MCP is available: verify issue-body checkboxes are closed with explicit evidence lines (file:line / commit hash / command output).

### Fail Fast Policy
- [ ] No silent fallbacks (errors fail loudly)
- [ ] No fake defaults (missing required config = error, not default)
- [ ] No swallowed exceptions
- [ ] Error messages are actionable

### Observability
- [ ] Every decision boundary has a structured log (key=value or JSON, not free-text prose)
- [ ] Every state transition logs before / after values and trigger
- [ ] Every external call (DB / API / file / subprocess) logs inputs, duration, outcome
- [ ] Quantifiable behaviour has metrics (counters, durations, success / failure ratios)
- [ ] State changes touching production data / money / user-visible behaviour have an append-only audit trail (actor + timestamp + reason)
- [ ] No `print()` as logging strategy (use a structured logger)
- [ ] No empty `except:` blocks, bare `pass` on exception, silent `return None` on error, or `continue` on unexpected state
- [ ] Logs are searchable (consistent field names, no log-and-pray)

### Code Reuse
- [ ] Searched the codebase before creating new modules (Glob / Grep / Explore) — **evidence required**: name 2-3 grep patterns or Glob queries actually run, with results count
- [ ] No duplicate modules created
- [ ] References existing modules where applicable

### Codebase Hygiene
- [ ] No dead code (unreachable, never-called functions)
- [ ] No obsolete code (deprecated, superseded by new implementation)
- [ ] No orphaned code (from failed / rescoped approaches)
- [ ] No commented-out "old" code blocks
- [ ] No unused imports / dependencies
- [ ] No leftover temp / WIP patterns

### Standards — Five Common Culprits (Logic)

> Trace code paths for the five recurring patterns. Category names canonical in `references/_common-culprits.md`.

**1. Duplicate Code (DRY / Modularity)**
- [ ] No same calculation logic in multiple files
- [ ] No repeated parsing / formatting patterns
- [ ] Could this be extracted to a shared utility?

**2. On-the-fly Calculations (Hardcoded Settings)**
- [ ] No inline math that depends on business rules (e.g. `price * 1.1` for markup)
- [ ] No date / time calculations with hardcoded offsets
- [ ] Should this formula be in a config file?

**3. Hardcoded Settings**
- [ ] No multipliers, percentages, thresholds in code
- [ ] No retry counts, timeout values, buffer sizes
- [ ] Is there a co-located YAML config this should be in?

**4. Obsolete / Dead Code (LMCE)**
- [ ] No functions that are never called (trace the call graph)
- [ ] No imports that are never used
- [ ] No feature flags for completed / removed features

**5. Silent Fallbacks (Fail Fast)**
- [ ] No `.get(key, {})` chains that hide missing data
- [ ] No `try / except: pass` or `catch(e) { }` empty handlers
- [ ] No `or default` that masks configuration errors
- [ ] Does the error path fail loudly with an actionable message?

**6. Cross-Boundary Contracts — Trace-Level**

> Logic-depth checks requiring cross-file tracing. These catch the bugs that syntactic scans miss.

**SQL / Schema Contracts**
- [ ] For every new / modified SQL query: list columns in WHERE / SELECT, open the migration for that table, confirm all columns exist
- [ ] Trace SQL query return values — if a query returns None / empty, verify the WHERE literal values match actual DB data (e.g. `side='SELL'` not `side='SLD'` if DB normalises on insert)
- [ ] Any query driving control flow (`if result:` / `if not result:`) has its column values cross-checked against DB schema

**Null / None Propagation**
- [ ] For functions with nullable parameters (`Optional[T]` or `T | None`): trace every call site — are callers guaranteed non-None, or must the function guard internally?
- [ ] Any function called at 2+ locations with a nullable input: verify the guard exists IN the function, not assumed from callers
- [ ] Frontend null-safety: trace API fields that can be null through to display / formatting — every `.toFixed()` on a nullable must have a null check

**Config Wiring (Bidirectional)**
- [ ] For every new YAML / config key: verify it is read by application code (grep key name → `config.get('key')` or `config['key']`)
- [ ] Config keys with zero code references = dead config = LMCE violation. Remove or wire.

**Lifecycle Wiring**
- [ ] For each recovery / drain / replay function: list ALL lifecycle entry points (startup, reconnect, restart) and verify it is called at EACH one
- [ ] "Called at reconnect" does NOT imply "called at startup" — verify separately

**Data Correction Completeness**
- [ ] For bugs that corrupt / mis-set data: verify a repair step exists covering ALL existing affected rows, not just future ones
- [ ] Run a count query to confirm zero remaining bad rows after repair

**Cross-Function Behavioural Contracts**
- [ ] For every `try / except` in the diff: open the wrapped function and confirm it has a reachable `raise` path. If it returns sentinel values (None, False), the `try / except` is dead code.
- [ ] Hot paths (fill handlers, order processors): count DB round-trips — flag any path querying the same row more than once

### Bash Output Discipline
- [ ] If you ran any bash command producing > 200 lines: capture output to a file, report only the path + verdict in RESULT. Do NOT paste the full output back to the main agent.

### Sample Invocation Gate (workflow validation)

Unit + smoke tests are necessary but NOT sufficient for pipeline / backtest / orchestration / CLI-wiring / cross-module function-arg propagation / persistent-state-write changes.

- [ ] **Scope check**: does this change touch any of the above? If **yes** → the next checkbox is mandatory. If **no** → document the scope-skip reason here.
- [ ] If in-scope: evidence of a REAL-CLI sample invocation exists — either a log file path, or an Issue comment with exit code + DB row-count + downstream-consumer verification. Exit code 0 alone is NOT sufficient.
- [ ] If in-scope: any mock used in the fix's tests uses explicit `call_args.kwargs["<key>"] == <expected>` assertions — NOT a `**kwargs`-swallowing mock that would pass regardless of whether the code actually propagated the arg.

### Required when available: Code Graph Checks

**Documentation-only PR exemption**: if the diff touches ONLY Markdown / YAML / JSON / TOML / shell, skip this section entirely. Document `[GRAPH: skipped — doc-only PR]` in RESULT and return PASS on graph checks.

Preconditions: a code-review-graph MCP server is available, graph fresh. If either fails, skip to the fallback clause below.

- [ ] For each modified function: `graph query callers_of(<function_name>)` → list all call sites; verify each handles the changed signature / behaviour.
- [ ] For each modified function: `graph query callees_of(<function_name>)` → confirm no newly-called functions have incompatible contracts (null-safety, config access).
- [ ] `graph query search(pattern)` for duplicate implementations: search for new calculation / parsing / schema-handling logic — confirm it doesn't already exist.
- [ ] **MCP-access discrimination**: every subagent RESULT block discussing graph queries starts with `mcp_graph_available: yes|no`. Yes + no graph-query evidence = FAIL (lazy fallback). No + grep fallback = PASS.

**Fallback clause** (retry-aware, evidence-required): if first graph call fails, retry once. If second fails, the RESULT block MUST include the Explore-subagent's RESULT block demonstrating manual call-graph audit was actually executed. Documenting only `[graph unavailable]` without subagent RESULT = silent skip = FAIL.

## Pass Criteria

All checkboxes verified with evidence (graph-backed + source spot-check, OR documented fallback + subagent RESULT block). If graph was available and not used for a structural question: FAIL. If doc-only PR exempted via the short-circuit above: PASS. If unavailable / stale / unsupported-language WITH subagent-backed fallback evidence: PASS.

## On Pass

Output: `<promise>SONNET_PASS</promise>`

## On Fail

1. List failed items with evidence of failure.
2. Specify which Fail Fast / Registry violation was found.
3. Do NOT output the promise.
4. Ralph loop restarts from Tier 1.
