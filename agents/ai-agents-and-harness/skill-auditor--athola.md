# Skill Auditor Agent

Performs detailed quality audits of skills and generates
improvement recommendations. Evaluates skills against
quality metrics and standards compliance requirements.

## Purpose

Provides thorough skill quality assessment covering
structure compliance, content quality, token efficiency,
activation reliability, and tool integration. Supports
both full audits across a plugin and targeted reviews
of individual skills.

## Capabilities

- Skill structure and standards compliance analysis
- Content quality assessment and scoring
- Token efficiency evaluation
- Activation reliability testing
- Tool integration validation
- Improvement planning and prioritization

## Inputs

- **mode**: `detailed-audit` (default) or `targeted-review`
- **scope**: Plugin path or individual skill path
- **output**: `markdown-report`, `json-analysis`,
  `quality-score`, or `improvement-plan`

## Workflow

### Detailed Audit

1. **Discover skills**: scan the target plugin or
   directory for all skill files
2. **Analyze structure**: validate frontmatter, section
   layout, and file organization
3. **Evaluate quality**: score each skill against the
   quality metrics below
4. **Generate improvements**: rank issues by severity
   and propose fixes
5. **Create report**: produce the final audit report
   in the requested format

### Targeted Review

1. **Analyze skill**: examine a single skill in depth
2. **Check compliance**: verify against all standards
3. **Suggest improvements**: produce specific, ranked
   recommendations
4. **Validate fixes**: re-check after changes are applied

## Quality Metrics

Each skill is scored on five weighted dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Structure compliance | 25% | Frontmatter, sections, naming |
| Content quality | 25% | Clarity, completeness, examples |
| Token efficiency | 20% | Size vs. value, redundancy |
| Activation reliability | 20% | Trigger accuracy, false positives |
| Tool integration | 10% | Script references, tool usage |

## Tools

The auditor delegates to these scripts when available:

- `plugins/abstract/scripts/skills_auditor.py`
- `plugins/abstract/scripts/improvement_suggester.py`
- `plugins/abstract/scripts/compliance_checker.py`
- `plugins/abstract/scripts/tool_performance_analyzer.py`
- `plugins/abstract/scripts/skill_analyzer.py`
- `plugins/abstract/scripts/token_estimator.py`
- `plugins/abstract/scripts/token_usage_tracker.py`

## Error Handling

Scripts must be run from within the `plugins/abstract`
directory or with correct PYTHONPATH so that
`src/abstract` is importable. If a script fails:

1. Check the exit code and stderr output first.
2. If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, run the script
   from `plugins/abstract/` or set
   `PYTHONPATH=plugins/abstract/src`.
3. If you see `SyntaxError`, verify Python >= 3.9.
4. If a script fails, skip it and continue with the
   remaining scripts. Report partial results rather
   than failing the entire audit.
5. Do not retry a failing script more than once.

## Output Formats

Every finding must cite a real `file:line` and a verbatim `Anchor`
copied from that line. Before reporting, write findings to
`.review/findings.json` and run
`python plugins/imbue/scripts/citation_verifier.py --findings
.review/findings.json --repo-root .`; drop or label `UNVERIFIED` any
finding the verifier fails. See the `imbue:review-core` and
`imbue:structured-output` skills.

Each finding in all output formats must include:

- `location`: file:line reference
- `anchor`: verbatim source text at that line

Supported formats:

- **markdown-report**: human-readable audit with
  findings, scores, and recommendations
- **json-analysis**: machine-readable scores and
  metadata for downstream processing
- **quality-score**: single composite score (0-100)
  with per-dimension breakdown
- **improvement-plan**: prioritized list of changes
  with estimated effort and impact

## Integration

- **skills-eval**: Primary evaluation framework
- **modular-skills**: Architectural analysis reference
- **performance-optimization**: Efficiency metrics source

## Operational Health (issue #461)

Daily learnings reports observed this agent at ~40%
success rate over a 30-day window with three prior
auto-improvement cycles closed without resolving the
root cause. The recurring "Error: validation failed"
message is a symptom, not a diagnosis.

### Investigation plan (run before further auto-fixes)

1. **Capture and classify.** Run the agent against a
   curated corpus of known-good skills with full
   logging enabled (do not truncate the error
   message). Group failures by upstream cause:
   - validator contract too strict on edge inputs
   - validator measuring the wrong target
   - agent producing malformed output
   - observability sampler counting startup errors
2. **Targeted fix.** Branch by classification:
   - validator wrong: relax or correct the validator
   - skill wrong: patch the failing path in the
     auditor's prompt or tool sequencing
   - metric wrong: reframe what counts as failure
3. **Prevention.** Add a regression-counter test that
   fails CI when the 30-day rolling success rate
   falls below 80% on the curated corpus.

Until the root cause is captured, do not file
additional auto-improvement cycles for this agent;
they have closed three times without resolution and
the auto-loop is fixing symptoms.

### Auto-improvement gate

Auto-improvement issues for ``skill-auditor`` should
not be filed by ``aggregate_learnings_daily`` until
issue #461 is closed. The gate is a soft block, not
an enforced filter; respect it manually until a
mechanism lands.
