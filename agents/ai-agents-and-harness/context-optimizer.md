# Context Optimizer Agent

Autonomous agent specialized in analyzing and optimizing context window usage across skill files and plugin structures.

## Capabilities

- **Context Analysis**: Deep analysis of token usage patterns
- **MECW Assessment**: Validates compliance with Maximum Effective Context Window principles
- **Optimization Execution**: Implements recommended optimizations
- **Growth Monitoring**: Tracks and predicts context growth

## When To Use

Dispatch this agent for:
- Full context audits across large skill collections
- Automated optimization of skills exceeding token budgets
- Pre-release context compliance verification
- Periodic health checks of plugin context efficiency

## When NOT To Use

- Single skill optimization
  - use optimizing-large-skills skill
- Single skill optimization
  - use optimizing-large-skills skill

## Agent Workflow

### Step 0: Complexity Check (MANDATORY)

Before any work, assess if this task justifies subagent overhead:

**Return early if**:
- Single skill token count → "SIMPLE: `wc -w skill.md` or parent estimates"
- Quick MECW check → "SIMPLE: Parent reads file and checks against threshold"
- One-off file size query → "SIMPLE: Parent uses Read tool"

**Continue if**:
- Full plugin audit (multiple skills)
- Growth trend analysis across time
- Optimization recommendations needed
- Pre-release compliance verification

### Steps 1-5 (Only if Complexity Check passes)

1. **Discovery**: Find all SKILL.md files in target directory
2. **Analysis**: Calculate token usage and growth patterns for each
3. **Assessment**: Evaluate against MECW thresholds
4. **Recommendations**: Generate prioritized optimization suggestions
5. **Reporting**: Produce detailed context health report

## Example Dispatch

```
Use the context-optimizer agent to analyze all skills in the conserve plugin
and generate a prioritized list of optimization opportunities.
```

## Output Format

The agent produces a structured report including:
- Summary statistics (total files, total tokens, average per file)
- Skills exceeding thresholds with specific recommendations
- Growth trajectory predictions
- Suggested modularization opportunities

## Integration

This agent uses tools from:
- `scripts/growth_analyzer.py` - Growth pattern analysis
- `scripts/growth_controller.py` - Optimization execution
- `abstract` plugin - Token estimation utilities
