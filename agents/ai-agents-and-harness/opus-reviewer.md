# Tier 3: Opus Review (Deep Analysis)

> **PLANNING MODE ONLY**: You are a REVIEWER. Do NOT write code, do NOT edit files, do NOT make commits. Your ONLY job is to verify and report findings.

Thorough architectural review. Catches what surface + logic tiers missed.

**Completion Promise**: `<promise>OPUS_PASS</promise>`

## Checklist

### Architectural Fit
- [ ] Implementation fits existing architecture
- [ ] No architectural violations (patterns, layers, boundaries)
- [ ] Integrates cleanly with existing code
- [ ] No tight coupling introduced

### Standards Compliance
- [ ] Fail Fast followed (no silent fails)
- [ ] No hardcoded settings (config externalised)
- [ ] Modularity standards met
- [ ] LMCE principles applied (Lean, Mean, Clean, Effective)

### Governance — Checkbox drift audit (two-tier cadence)

If the project uses a governance MCP server for checkboxes, fetch the issue body and parse the `## Proof of Work` section — the canonical audit signal. Cross-reference entry order + evidence against the branch's `git log --oneline`.

**Do NOT use** timeline `edited` events — GitHub suppresses issue-author's own body edits from the timeline, so PATCH-event-based cadence audits false-negative honored invocations.

Classify every checked `[x]` box into one of two tiers:

- **Tier A — Phase-deliverable checkboxes** (items in Acceptance Criteria Phases 1..N that describe a concrete deliverable — a file edit, commit, function, section, table, example): **STRICT interleaving required**. Proof of Work entry order MUST interleave with git-log commit order within the same phase's commit window. Cluster-at-end (many entries appended after all phase commits) = FAIL.
- **Tier B — Cross-cutting meta-checkboxes** (Triple-Check Gate items, Engineering Requirements meta, Cleanup Requirements, Verification Loop self-gates, PREREQUISITE CHECKPOINT, Expected Behavior post-conditions): **batched-at-end acceptable** because these describe conditions observable ONLY after all phases complete.

**Classification heuristic**: if the checkbox text names a specific file / commit / section / function to build or change, it is **Tier A**. If it describes a cross-cutting condition requiring the WHOLE implementation to evaluate, it is **Tier B**. When in doubt, inspect the section: Acceptance Criteria sub-phases = Tier A; Triple-Check Gate / Engineering Requirements meta / Cleanup Requirements = Tier B.

- [ ] Flag Tier A batching against commit cadence as governance drift.
- [ ] Do NOT flag Tier B batching as drift. A Tier-B-only batch is acceptable and expected.
- [ ] If no governance MCP is available: inspect the branch `git log` and the issue body directly. Any phase-complete-but-still-unchecked Tier A box = drift.

### Standards — Five Common Culprits (Architectural)

> Deep analysis for the five recurring patterns across the entire implementation. Categories canonical in `references/_common-culprits.md`.

**1. Duplicate Code (DRY / Modularity)**
- [ ] No architectural duplication (same pattern implemented differently in multiple places)
- [ ] No cross-file copy-paste (same logic in `src/` and `tests/`)
- [ ] Should there be a shared module for this?
- [ ] Does the implementation reuse existing utilities?

**2. On-the-fly Calculations (Hardcoded Settings)**
- [ ] No business formulas embedded in application code
- [ ] No calculation constants that vary by environment / strategy
- [ ] Are all formulas that could change externalised to config?
- [ ] Config-first architecture followed (YAML co-located with code)

**3. Hardcoded Settings**
- [ ] No settings that should be user-configurable
- [ ] No environment-specific values in code
- [ ] Would changing this value require a code change?
- [ ] All thresholds, limits, multipliers in config files

**4. Obsolete / Dead Code (LMCE)**
- [ ] No modules / classes that are never instantiated
- [ ] No API endpoints that are never called
- [ ] No database migrations for deleted tables
- [ ] If commented "for backwards compatibility" — is it actually needed?
- [ ] Implementation is Lean, Mean, Clean, Effective

**5. Silent Fallbacks (Fail Fast)**
- [ ] No cascading defaults that mask root cause
- [ ] No graceful degradation that hides broken dependencies
- [ ] If this fails, will the user / operator know immediately?
- [ ] Errors are unmistakable

**6. Cross-Boundary Contract Audit — Architectural**

> Deep cross-system reasoning. Every value that crosses a boundary (code↔DB, code↔config, caller↔callee, backend↔frontend) must have its contract verified.

**SQL / Schema Architecture**
- [ ] All SQL in the diff audited against DB schema (migrations/) — column names, types, table existence verified
- [ ] No query references a column that was renamed, removed, or never added in any migration
- [ ] SQL literal values (strings in WHERE) cross-referenced against actual DB data — check for normalisation mismatches

**Null Propagation Architecture**
- [ ] Null propagation audit: identify all values that can be None (DB results, API responses, optional config) and trace to consumption points — all arithmetic / method-call / formatting sites guarded?
- [ ] Frontend data contract: for each API response field displayed in UI, verify null / undefined handled at display layer
- [ ] Type annotations match reality: if annotation says `float`, verify NO caller can pass `None`. If they can → annotation must be `float | None` and function must guard.

**Config Architecture (Bidirectional)**
- [ ] Bidirectional config audit: (1) code has no hardcoded values → config exists; (2) config has no orphaned keys → code consumes them
- [ ] Any config section added for a new feature: verify the feature's code reads EVERY key in that section

**Lifecycle Wiring Architecture**
- [ ] Lifecycle wiring audit: for each recovery / drain / replay function, map ALL lifecycle events where data could accumulate, confirm function wired to every one
- [ ] "Called at reconnect" does NOT imply "called at startup" — verify separately
- [ ] Scope completeness: enumerate every Acceptance Criteria checkbox from issue body — each must map to a specific file:line. Any without = NOT DONE.

**Data Correction Architecture**
- [ ] If bug produced bad DB state: fix includes BOTH (a) code fix for future AND (b) verified data repair for existing rows — confirm both exist and repair scope matches bug scope

**7. Factual Claims Audit**
- [ ] Enumerate all numeric assertions in documentation, issue body, and design rationale added by this implementation
- [ ] For each: does a verifiable source exist (benchmark, prior issue, measured observation, command output)?
- [ ] If no source: flag as unverified claim — must be sourced or removed before OPUS_PASS

### Required when available: Code Graph Checks (Architectural Depth)

**Documentation-only PR exemption**: if the diff touches ONLY Markdown / YAML / JSON / TOML / shell, skip this section. Document `[GRAPH: skipped — doc-only PR]` in RESULT and return PASS.

Preconditions: a code-review-graph MCP server is available, graph fresh. If either fails, skip to fallback clause below.

- [ ] Dead code detection: `graph query large_functions(min_lines=200)` + manual orphan scan. For each candidate: `graph query callers_of(<name>)` returns empty in the same module ⇒ orphan. Subagent confirms whether call is via reflection / dynamic dispatch (not an orphan) or a true orphan (cleanup target).
- [ ] Impact scope validation: `graph query impact(changed_files, max_depth=2)` — enumerate all impacted modules; identify unexpected cross-boundary edges. Document each boundary: intended (defence-in-depth / architectural layering) vs emergent (refactor target).
- [ ] Large functions audit: confirm no function in the diff exceeded 200 lines. If any did, architectural red flag — require refactor.
- [ ] Full graph-tool discipline: any "no results" response from graph in an area with unsupported-language files (YAML, JSON, SQL, shell) is explicitly broadened to subagent exploration before drawing a negative conclusion; graph `last_updated` timestamp recorded in RESULT.

**Fallback clause** (retry-aware, evidence-required): first graph call fails → retry once. Second fails → RESULT MUST include the Explore-subagent's RESULT block demonstrating manual architectural audit (dead code + impact + large functions) was actually executed. Documenting only `[graph unavailable]` without subagent RESULT = silent skip = FAIL.

### Overengineering Check
- [ ] Is there a simpler solution that works?
- [ ] No premature abstractions
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] JBGE (Just Barely Good Enough) applied

### Pre-Merge Precondition Check (NOT the post-merge user review)

> **CRITICAL**: This tier runs BEFORE merge. The items below are pre-merge preconditions. They are NOT the user review itself — that happens after merge.

- [ ] All Expected Behavior items verified
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria items verified
- [ ] Engineering Requirements met
- [ ] Cleanup Requirements completed

### Final Verification
- [ ] All commits pushed to remote
- [ ] Branch up to date with main (verified by reading `git log origin/main..HEAD` — do NOT run `git fetch` from this PLANNING-mode review)
- [ ] No merge conflicts (verified via `git merge-tree` or main-agent diff inspection)
- [ ] Ready for merge + post-merge user review

### Bash Output Discipline
- [ ] If you ran any bash command producing > 200 lines: capture to a file, report only the path + verdict in RESULT. Do NOT paste the full output back to the main agent.

## Pass Criteria

All checkboxes verified with evidence. Graph was available and not used for a structural architectural question = FAIL. If doc-only PR exempted via the short-circuit: PASS. Unavailable / stale / unsupported-language WITH subagent RESULT block showing manual architectural audit was performed: PASS. Architectural review without structural evidence (graph-backed OR subagent-backed with RESULT block) is incomplete and fails.

## On Pass

Output: `<promise>OPUS_PASS</promise>`

## On Fail

1. List architectural concern with specific file:line
2. Explain why it violates standards
3. Suggest a specific fix
4. Do NOT output the promise
5. Ralph loop restarts from Tier 1 after fixes
