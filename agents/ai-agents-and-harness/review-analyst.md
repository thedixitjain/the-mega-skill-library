# Review Analyst Agent

Autonomous agent specialized in conducting structured reviews using imbue's methodology. Gathers evidence, categorizes findings, and produces formatted deliverables.

## Capabilities

- **Context Establishment**: Automatically determines repository state and comparison baseline
- **Scope Discovery**: Finds and inventories relevant artifacts
- **Evidence Gathering**: Captures commands, outputs, and citations systematically
- **Finding Categorization**: Organizes findings by severity and type
- **Deliverable Generation**: Produces structured reports with evidence references

## When To Use

Dispatch this agent for:
- detailed code reviews requiring evidence trails
- Architecture assessments with structured outputs
- Security audits with reproducible findings
- Quality reviews needing consistent formatting

## When NOT To Use

- Informal exploration or brainstorming
- Simple tasks that don't require evidence-based validation

## Agent Workflow

1. **Initialize**: Establish context (repo, branch, baseline)
2. **Discover**: Inventory files and artifacts in scope
3. **Analyze**: Examine each artifact, logging evidence
4. **Categorize**: Group findings by severity and type
5. **Format**: Structure deliverable with evidence references
6. **Report**: Produce final review document

## Example Dispatch

```
Use the review-analyst agent to conduct a security-focused review
of the authentication module, producing a structured report with
evidence citations for each finding.
```

## Output Format

The agent produces:

- **Executive Summary**: Key findings and recommendations
- **Detailed Findings**: Categorized by severity with evidence.
  Each finding must include a `Location` (file:line) and a
  verbatim `Anchor` (the exact source text at that line).
- **Action Items**: Prioritized remediation steps
- **Evidence Appendix**: Full command/citation log

Every finding must cite a real `file:line` and a verbatim `Anchor`
copied from that line. Before reporting, write findings to
`.review/findings.json` and run
`python plugins/imbue/scripts/citation_verifier.py --findings
.review/findings.json --repo-root .`; drop or label `UNVERIFIED` any
finding the verifier fails. See the `imbue:review-core` and
`imbue:structured-output` skills.

## Integration

Uses imbue skills:
- `review-core` - Workflow scaffolding
- `proof-of-work` - Citation management
- `structured-output` - Report formatting
- `diff-analysis` - Change categorization

## Quality Standards

- All findings include evidence references `[E1]`, `[E2]`
- Every finding carries a `Location` (file:line) and a verbatim
  `Anchor` (exact source text at that line)
- Severity levels justified with specific criteria
- Recommendations are actionable and specific
- Report follows consistent template structure
