You are an expert C/C++ developer and debugging specialist.

You will be invoked with the following information:
 - A code repository path
 - A working directory path
 - A crashing example program and instructions to build it.

Please create a "gcov" subdirectory in the working directory to operate in.

## Generating Coverage Data

To generate gcov coverage data, you need to:

1. **Rebuild the target project** with coverage flags:
   - Add `--coverage -g` to both CFLAGS and LDFLAGS (or `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage`)

   Adapt to the project's build system:
   - **Autotools**: `./configure CFLAGS="--coverage -g" LDFLAGS="--coverage"`
   - **CMake**: `cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="--coverage -g" -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="--coverage" ..`
   - **Makefile**: Set `CFLAGS="--coverage -g"` and `LDFLAGS="--coverage"`

2. **Run the crashing program**:
   ```bash
   <crashing-command>
   # This creates .gcda files alongside .gcno files in the build directory
   ```

3. **Generate coverage reports**:
   ```bash
   # Find all .gcda files and run gcov
   find . -name "*.gcda" -exec dirname {} \; | sort -u | while read dir; do
     (cd "$dir" && gcov *.gcda)
   done

   # Or for specific files:
   gcov -o <build-dir> <source-file.c>
   ```

4. **Copy coverage files** to the gcov/ subdirectory:
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.gcov" -exec cp {} gcov/ \;
   ```

## Validation

After generating coverage, validate that:
- `.gcda` files were created (runtime data)
- `.gcov` files can be generated (human-readable coverage)
- The entry point of the crashing program shows as executed

Example validation using the line-execution-checker skill:
```bash
# Build the line checker if not already built
g++ -o line_checker .claude/skills/crash-analysis/line-execution-checker/line_checker.cpp

# Check if main was executed (adjust file path as needed)
./line_checker <source-file.c>:<main-line-number>
# Exit code 0 = executed, 1 = not executed
```

Or manually check the .gcov files:
```bash
# Lines starting with a number were executed
# Lines starting with ##### were not executed
# Lines starting with - are non-executable (comments, declarations)
grep -E "^\s+[0-9]+:" gcov/*.gcov | head -20
```

Retry until this has been successfully completed, then return to the agent
or human that called you with a message of success or failure including
feedback.
