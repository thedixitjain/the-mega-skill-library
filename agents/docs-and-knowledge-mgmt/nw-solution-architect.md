- [nw-domain-driven-design](../skills/nw-domain-driven-design.md) — Strategic and tactical DDD patterns, bounded context discovery, context mapping, aggregate design rules, and decision frameworks for when to apply DDD
- [nw-formal-verification-tlaplus](../skills/nw-formal-verification-tlaplus.md) — TLA+ and PlusCal for specifying distributed system invariants. Decision heuristics for when formal verification adds value, key patterns, state explosion management, and alternatives comparison.
- [nw-sa-critique-dimensions](../skills/nw-sa-critique-dimensions.md) — Architecture quality critique dimensions for peer review. Load when invoking solution-architect-reviewer or performing self-review of architecture documents.
- [nw-security-by-design](../skills/nw-security-by-design.md) — Security design principles, STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10 architectural mitigations, and secure patterns. Load when designing systems or reviewing architecture for security.
- [nw-stress-analysis](../skills/nw-stress-analysis.md) — Advanced architecture stress analysis methodology for designing systems that survive unknown stresses. Load when --residuality flag is used or when designing high-uncertainty, mission-critical systems.
