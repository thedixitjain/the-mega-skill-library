# nw-acceptance-designer

Use for DISTILL wave — designs E2E acceptance tests from user stories and architecture using Given-When-Then format. EXPANDED scope (plan v3 §3.A, 2026-05-19) — exclusive test-expertise owner; authors ATs with maximum PBT + parametrize density, runs self-completeness audit (7-category taxonomy + 15-item checklist), enforces Mandate-12 step-reuse ≥4× target informational, consults DISCUSS+DESIGN+DEVOPS upstream waves for taxonomy population (C2/C5/C6/C7). Creates executable specifications that drive Outside-In TDD development.

**Wave:** DISTILL
**Model:** inherit
**Max turns:** 0
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task

## Commands

- [`/nw-devops`](../commands/index.md)
- [`/nw-distill`](../commands/index.md)
- [`/nw-finalize`](../commands/index.md)

## Skills

- [nw-ad-critique-dimensions](../skills/nw-ad-critique-dimensions.md) — Review dimensions for acceptance test quality - happy path bias, GWT compliance, business language purity, coverage completeness, walking skeleton user-centricity, priority validation, observable behavior assertions, traceability coverage, and walking skeleton boundary proof
- [nw-at-completeness-check](../skills/nw-at-completeness-check.md) — Canonical AT completeness gate — research-anchored 7-category taxonomy (C1-C7) + 15-item mechanical checklist. Paradigm-neutral. Drives acceptance-designer reviewer verdict deterministically.
- [nw-bdd-methodology](../skills/nw-bdd-methodology.md) — BDD patterns for acceptance test design - Given-When-Then structure, scenario writing rules, pytest-bdd implementation, anti-patterns, and living documentation
- [nw-distill](../skills/nw-distill.md) — Acceptance test creation methodology for the DISTILL wave. Domain knowledge for the acceptance designer agent: port-to-port principle, prior wave reading, wave-decision reconciliation, graceful degradation, and document back-propagation.
- [nw-property-based-testing](../skills/nw-property-based-testing.md) — Property-based testing strategies, mutation testing, shrinking, and combined PBT+mutation workflow for test quality validation
- [nw-tdd-methodology](../skills/nw-tdd-methodology.md) — Deep knowledge for Outside-In TDD - double-loop architecture, ATDD integration, port-to-port testing, walking skeletons, and test doubles policy
- [nw-test-design-mandates](../skills/nw-test-design-mandates.md) — Design mandates for acceptance tests - hexagonal boundary, business language abstraction, user journey completeness, pure function extraction, 3 Pillars (domain language / chained narrative / production composition), and the layered ATD discipline (Universe-bound assertion, layer-dependent PBT mode, two-tier acceptance, example-based sad paths)
- [nw-test-optimization](../skills/nw-test-optimization.md) — Methodology for minimizing test count while maximizing behavioral coverage - behavior definition, anti-pattern catalog, consolidation patterns, stopping criterion, coverage-preserving validation
- [nw-test-organization-conventions](../skills/nw-test-organization-conventions.md) — Test directory structure patterns by architecture style, language conventions, naming rules, and fixture placement. Decision tree for selecting test organization strategy.
- [nw-test-refactoring-catalog](../skills/nw-test-refactoring-catalog.md) — Detailed refactoring mechanics with step-by-step procedures, and test code smell catalog with detection patterns and before/after examples
