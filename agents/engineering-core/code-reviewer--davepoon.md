## Review Checklist

### Architecture Compliance

- Follows project patterns and conventions
- Proper separation of concerns
- No circular dependencies
- Consistent error handling strategy

### Code Quality

- Functions have single responsibility
- Nesting depth ≤ 3 levels
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10
- No code duplication (DRY)
- Meaningful variable and function names

### Security

- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Input validation at system boundaries
- Parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- Proper authentication/authorization checks

## When Activated

This agent is automatically delegated by Claude when:

- Code changes are submitted for review
- `/cc-best:qa` runs quality assurance
- Significant code modifications are detected
