# **Multi-Chain Reasoning Prompting**

Authored by Kalyan KS. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/kalyan_kpl) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyanksnlp/) for latest LLM, RAG and Agent updates.

## **Overview**

Multi-Chain Reasoning Prompting (MCR, also called Meta-Chain Reasoning) is an advanced way to ask a Large Language Model (LLM) to solve a problem. Instead of asking the LLM for a single answer, you first ask it to generate multiple different thinking processes (called "Chain-of-Thought" paths) for the same problem. Once it has these multiple chains, it performs a second-level, or "meta," reasoning step. 

This means the model acts as a smart editor or synthesizer: it reviews and compares all the different steps it generated to form a final improved answer. Thus it can correct cases where none of the single chains were perfect, but by combining pieces of different chains you can get a better result.

You are given multiple reasoning chains generated independently for the
same question. Your task is to:

1. Compare all reasoning chains.
2. Identify errors, inconsistencies, or weaknesses.
3. Combine the correct reasoning steps from all chains to form a
   refined, more robust meta-reasoning.
4. Produce the final free-form answer.

===== META CHAIN REASONING OUTPUT =====
{
  "meta_reasoning": "All three reasoning chains correctly identify the necessary steps to solve the problem. They all begin by calculating the train's arrival time in the starting city's time zone. This is done by adding the travel duration (4 hours and 35 minutes) to the departure time (8:15 AM). \n\nStarting with 8:15 AM, adding 4 hours results in 12:15 PM. Then, adding 35 minutes to 12:15 PM yields an arrival time of 12:50 PM in the starting city's time zone.\n\nNext, all chains correctly account for the time zone difference. The problem states the destination city is 2 hours 'ahead' of the starting city's time zone. Therefore, 2 hours must be added to the arrival time calculated in the starting city's time zone.\n\nAdding 2 hours to 12:50 PM results in 2:50 PM.\n\nAll chains consistently follow these steps and arrive at the same correct final answer. There are no errors, inconsistencies, or weaknesses found across the chains; they are all sound and demonstrate a clear understanding of time calculations and time zone adjustments.",
  "answer": "The train arrives at 2:50 PM in the destination city."
}

===== ALL GENERATED CANDIDATE CHAINS =====

--- Candidate 1 ---
1. **Determine the departure time:** The train leaves at 8:15 AM.
2. **Calculate the travel duration:** The journey takes 4 hours and 35 minutes.
3. **Calculate the arrival time in the starting city's time zone:**
    *   Add 4 hours to 8:15 AM: 8:15 AM + 4 hours = 12:15 PM.
    *   Add 35 minutes to 12:15 PM: 12:15 PM + 35 minutes = 12:50 PM.
    *   So, the train arrives at 12:50 PM in the starting city's time zone.
4. **Adjust for the time zone difference:** The destination city is 2 hours ahead of the starting city.
    *   Add 2 hours to the arrival time calculated in step 3: 12:50 PM + 2 hours = 2:50 PM.
5. **State the final arrival time:** The train arrives at 2:50 PM in the destination city's time zone.
Answer: The train arrives at 2:50 PM in the destination city.

--- Candidate 2 ---
The train leaves at 8:15 AM. The travel duration is 4 hours and 35 minutes. First, we calculate the arrival time in the starting city's time zone. 
- Add 4 hours to 8:15 AM: 8:15 AM + 4 hours = 12:15 PM.
- Add 35 minutes to 12:15 PM: 12:15 PM + 35 minutes = 12:50 PM.
So, the train arrives at 12:50 PM in the starting city's time zone.
The destination city is 2 hours ahead of the starting city's time zone. Therefore, we need to add 2 hours to the calculated arrival time.
- 12:50 PM + 2 hours = 2:50 PM.
Thus, the train arrives at 2:50 PM in the destination city's time.
Answer: The train arrives at 2:50 PM at the destination city.

--- Candidate 3 ---
The train leaves at 8:15 AM. The travel duration is 4 hours and 35 minutes.

First, calculate the arrival time in the starting city's time zone:
Start Time: 8:15 AM
Add 4 hours: 8:15 AM + 4 hours = 12:15 PM
Add 35 minutes: 12:15 PM + 35 minutes = 12:50 PM
So, the train arrives at 12:50 PM in the starting city's time zone.

Next, adjust for the time zone difference. The destination city is 2 hours ahead of the starting city.
Arrival time in starting city's time zone: 12:50 PM
Add 2 hours for the time zone difference: 12:50 PM + 2 hours = 2:50 PM.

Therefore, the train arrives at 2:50 PM in the destination city's time.
Answer: The train arrives at 2:50 PM in the destination city.

A train leaves at 8:15 AM and takes 4 hours and 35 minutes to reach its destination.

Example Chain-of-Thought:
First compute the arrival time in the starting city.
8:15 AM + 4 hours 35 minutes = 12:50 PM local time.
The destination city is 2 hours ahead, so convert 12:50 PM to destination time:
12:50 PM + 2 hours = 2:50 PM.

===== FINAL META-SYNTHESIZED ANSWER =====
{

There are no factual errors or inconsistencies in the reasoning steps across the chains. The only minor difference lies in the phrasing of the final answer. Chains [2] and [3] provide a concise answer ('Brasília, South America'), while Chain [1] provides a more complete sentence that explicitly answers both parts of the question ('The capital city of the largest country in South America is Brasília, and it is located on the continent of South America.'). For a 'free-form answer' that fully addresses the prompt 'Identify... and then state...', Chain [1]'s final answer is slightly more complete and directly responsive to both clauses of the question. Therefore, the improved, unified chain will consolidate the consistent correct reasoning, and the final answer will adopt the more comprehensive phrasing from Chain [1].",

Answer: The capital city of the largest country in South America is Brasília, and it is located on the continent of South America.
