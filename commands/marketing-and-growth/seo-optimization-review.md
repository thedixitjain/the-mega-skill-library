   Identify search opportunities:

   Natural placement:

   - Reading time
   - Technical content categorization

7. **Internal linking opportunities**
   Identify places to link:
   - Related blog posts
   - Documentation
   - GitHub repos
   - Tool pages
   - Previous work

8. **Image optimization**
   For all images/diagrams:
   - Descriptive file names

   - Captions where helpful
   - Optimal file sizes
