# validate-pr

Generate and self-execute a step-by-step validation plan matched to what
actually changed in a PR. Bridges the gap between "tests pass" and "the
fix does what it claims."

## When To Use

- Standalone after any PR fix, to produce targeted validation evidence
- Called automatically by `/fix-pr` at the end of Step 5 (Validate)
- When you need proof that revert-tests catch regressions

## When NOT To Use

- `--scope minor` in `/fix-pr` with only formatting or doc changes
- No diff available (clean branch, nothing changed)
- Pass `--skip-validate` to `/fix-pr` to bypass

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<pr-number>` | Target PR number (default: current branch PR) |
| `<pr-url>` | Full GitHub or GitLab URL to the PR |
| `--post` | Post the summary table as a PR comment |
| `--revert-tests <N>` | Number of revert-test quality checks to run (default: 1) |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Run on current branch PR
/sanctum:validate-pr

# Run on a specific PR
/sanctum:validate-pr 123

# Run and post results as a PR comment
/sanctum:validate-pr 123 --post

# Run with two revert-test checks
/sanctum:validate-pr 123 --revert-tests 2
```

## Workflow

See `Skill(sanctum:validate-pr)` for the full algorithm:

1. Fetch the PR diff and group changed files by area (Rust, Python, Shell,
   grammar, build/config)
2. Generate at least one verification step per area
3. Execute each step, capture output as evidence (`[E1]`, `[E2]`, ...)
4. Run a revert-test quality check: break a representative fix, confirm
   the corresponding test fails, restore via `git checkout -- <file>`
5. Run the final full-suite test (cargo test --workspace or uv run pytest)
6. Produce a summary table: Area | Step | Evidence | Result
7. If `--post`: post the table as a PR comment

## Failure Behaviour

If any step produces **FAIL**, the command reports all failures and exits
with non-zero status. When called from `/fix-pr`, it halts before Step 6
(Complete / Gate 3). Pass `--skip-validate` to `/fix-pr` to bypass.

## Output Format

```markdown
### validate-pr: PR #123

| Area | Step | Evidence | Result |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| Rust: token-types | cargo build --workspace | [E1] 0 errors | PASS |
| Rust: token-types | cargo test -p token-types | [E2] 12 passed | PASS |
| Shell: hooks/pre-commit | shellcheck | [E3] 0 issues | PASS |
| Revert-test: lib.rs:45 | break/fail/restore | [RT-1..5] genuine guard | PASS |
| Final: cargo test --workspace | full suite | [E4] 694 passed | PASS |

**Totals**: 5 steps — 5 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 INCONCLUSIVE
```
