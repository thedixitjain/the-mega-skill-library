# Step 5: Validate (Test & Verify)

> **Navigation**: [← Step 4: Fix](4-fix.md) | [Main Workflow](../workflow-steps.md) | [Step 6: Complete →](6-complete.md)

**Purpose**: Ensure all fixes are correct and quality gates pass.

**Skip when**: Already validated manually.

## 5.1 Version Validation (MANDATORY IF APPLICABLE)

**CRITICAL: If `/pr-review` flagged any version issues (B-VERSION), you MUST verify they were fixed.**

Before proceeding to test plan execution, re-run version validation to confirm all version files are now consistent.

**Check for Version Issues in Review:**
```bash
# Check if version validation issues were flagged in the review
# Look for B-VERSION tags in review comments or test plan
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("B-VERSION")) | .body'
```

**Re-run Version Validation (if version issues existed):**
    ```bash
    # Detect project type
    PROJECT_TYPE=""
    if [[ -f ".claude-plugin/marketplace.json" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="claude-marketplace"
    elif [[ -f "pyproject.toml" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="python"
    elif [[ -f "package.json" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="node"
    elif [[ -f "Cargo.toml" ]]; then
      PROJECT_TYPE="rust"
    fi

    # Re-validate based on project type
    case $PROJECT_TYPE in
      claude-marketplace)
        # Verify marketplace.json matches all plugin.json files
        ECOSYSTEM_VERSION=$(jq -r '.metadata.version' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
        echo "Ecosystem version: $ECOSYSTEM_VERSION"

        MISMATCHES=0
        jq -r '.plugins[] | "\(.name):\(.version)"' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | while IFS=: read -r name version; do
          if [[ -f "plugins/$name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" ]]; then
            ACTUAL=$(jq -r '.version' "plugins/$name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json")
            if [[ "$version" != "$ACTUAL" ]]; then
              echo "❌ STILL MISMATCHED: $name (marketplace=$version, actual=$ACTUAL)"
              MISMATCHES=$((MISMATCHES + 1))
            else
              echo "✓ $name: $version"
            fi
          fi
        done

        # Check CHANGELOG entry exists
        if [[ -f "CHANGELOG.md" ]] && ! grep -q "\[$ECOSYSTEM_VERSION\]" CHANGELOG.md; then
          echo "❌ CHANGELOG.md still missing entry for $ECOSYSTEM_VERSION"
          MISMATCHES=$((MISMATCHES + 1))
        fi
        ;;

      python)
        # Verify pyproject.toml matches __version__ in code
        TOML_VERSION=$(grep "^version" pyproject.toml | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
        if [[ -d "src" ]]; then
          VERSION_PY=$(find src -name "__init__.py" -exec grep -l "__version__" {} \; | head -1)
          if [[ -n "$VERSION_PY" ]]; then
            CODE_VERSION=$(grep "__version__" "$VERSION_PY" | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
            if [[ "$TOML_VERSION" != "$CODE_VERSION" ]]; then
              echo "❌ STILL MISMATCHED: pyproject.toml=$TOML_VERSION, $VERSION_PY=$CODE_VERSION"
            else
              echo "✓ Python versions consistent: $TOML_VERSION"
            fi
          fi
        fi
        ;;

      node)
        # Verify package.json matches package-lock.json
        PKG_VERSION=$(jq -r '.version' package.json)
        if [[ -f "package-lock.json" ]]; then
          LOCK_VERSION=$(jq -r '.version' package-lock.json)
          if [[ "$PKG_VERSION" != "$LOCK_VERSION" ]]; then
            echo "❌ STILL MISMATCHED: package.json=$PKG_VERSION, package-lock.json=$LOCK_VERSION"
          else
            echo "✓ Node versions consistent: $PKG_VERSION"
          fi
        fi
        ;;

      rust)
        # Verify Cargo.toml version
        CARGO_VERSION=$(grep "^version" Cargo.toml | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
        echo "✓ Cargo.toml version: $CARGO_VERSION"
        # Check Cargo.lock is updated (regenerated)
        if [[ -f "Cargo.lock" ]]; then
          echo "ℹ️ Verify Cargo.lock was regenerated after version update"
        fi
        ;;
    esac
    ```

**Version Validation Must Pass**

**If any version mismatches remain, DO NOT proceed. Fix them first.**

| Version Issue Type | Fix Required |
|-------------------|--------------|
| marketplace.json vs plugin.json mismatch | Update marketplace.json OR plugin.json to match |
| pyproject.toml vs __version__ mismatch | Sync both to same version |
| package.json vs package-lock.json mismatch | Run `npm install` to regenerate lock |
| Missing CHANGELOG entry | Add entry for new version |

## 5.2 Execute Test Plan

After applying fixes and version validation, execute the test plan generated by `/pr-review`.

**Locate Test Plan:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Check if test plan was saved to file
   ls .pr-review/test-plan-*.md 2>/dev/null

   # Option 2: Search PR comments for test plan (generated by /pr-review)
   # Look for comments with "## Test Plan for PR #"
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments \
     --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("## Test Plan for PR")) | {id: .id, created_at: .created_at, body: .body}'
   ```

   **Test Plan Discovery Rules:**
   - Check for local file first (`.pr-review/test-plan-*.md`)
   - If not found, search PR comments for "## Test Plan for PR #N"
   - The test plan comment contains:
     - Prerequisites checklist
     - Verification steps for each issue (numbered: B1, B2, S1, S2, etc.)
     - Quality gate commands
     - Summary checklist table
   - Parse the test plan and create TodoWrite items for each verification step

## 5.3 Execute Verification Steps

For each issue in the test plan, run the verification steps:

    ```markdown
    ### Test Plan Execution

    #### B1: Missing token validation
    - [x] Review the fix at `middleware/auth.py:45`
    - [x] Run: `pytest tests/test_auth.py -k "token_validation" -v` → PASSED
    - [x] Manual check: Invalid token returns 401 [DONE]
    - [x] Error response verified [DONE]

    #### B2: SQL injection vulnerability
    - [x] Review the fix at `models/user.py:123`
    - [x] Run: `bandit -r models/ -ll` → No high-severity issues
    - [x] Run: `pytest tests/test_models.py -k "sql" -v` → PASSED
    - [x] Parameterized queries verified [DONE]
    ```

## 5.4 Agent-Verify Manual Test Plan

After automated verification steps, scan PR comments for a
**reviewer-written manual test plan** and attempt to verify
each item programmatically. Human QA still owns final sign-off,
but agent pre-verification catches issues early and provides
evidence for the reviewer.

**Verification surface area**: shell commands, validators,
HTTP probes, headless browser actions (CDP-based MCP tool or
Playwright spec), and, as a last resort, desktop GUI
control. The strategy table in 5.4.2 maps test-item shapes to
the lightest tool that can answer them; the tier-selection
guide in 5.4.5 covers when to escalate from Tier 1 (MCP CDP)
to Tier 2 (Playwright) to Tier 3 (Computer Use).

### 5.4.1 Discover Manual Test Plan Items

Search PR comments for checkbox-style test plans written by
reviewers (distinct from the `/pr-review`-generated test plan
in 5.2):

```bash
# Fetch comments containing checkbox items
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | test("- \\[[ x]\\]")) | .body'
```

**Identification heuristics:**
- Comments titled "Test Plan" or containing checkbox lists
- Authored by reviewers (not the PR author or bots)
- Items phrased as verification actions ("Verify...",
  "Run...", "Check...", "Ensure...")

Extract each `- [ ]` item into a work list. If no manual
test plan exists, skip to 5.5.

### 5.4.2 Classify Each Item and Choose Strategy

For each manual test item, determine the best verification
approach. Be creative: most "manual" checks can be at least
partially automated:

| Pattern in test item | Strategy | Example command |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| "Run X tests" | Execute the test command directly | `cd plugins/foo && uv run pytest tests/ -v` |
| "Verify X works/fails when Y" | Simulate condition Y, run X, check output | Remove import, run target, check error msg |
| "Check X is valid Y" | Run a validator or parser | `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('f.yml'))"` |
| "Spot-check that all X references updated" | Search for stale pattern | `rg 'old-pattern' --glob '*.md'` (or `grep -r --include='*.md'`) |
| "Verify X was updated to Y" | Read file and assert content | Read file, check the specific line |
| "Ensure X discovers both A and B" | Run discovery, check output contains both | Execute script, grep output for A and B |
| "Update X" (imperative fix item) | Verify the fix was applied | `git diff origin/BASE -- path/to/file` |
| "Verify endpoint/API returns X" | HTTP probe with curl/httpie, assert response | `curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:PORT/api -d '{...}' \| jq -e '.field=="value"'` |
| "Check the page/UI shows X" | Drive browser via MCP tool, assert DOM/text | `mcp__plugin_superpowers-chrome_chrome__use_browser` (CDP-based, lightweight). See 5.4.5 |
| "Smoke-test the flow A->B->C" | Playwright spec executing the full path | `npx playwright test specs/pr-NNN-smoke.spec.ts` (see `scry:browser-recording` for spec patterns) |
| "Visual regression / screenshot" | Playwright screenshot and diff against baseline | `page.screenshot({path: 'after.png'})` then `compare-images` |
| "Workflow involves desktop GUI" | Last resort: full Computer Use sandbox | `Skill(phantom:computer-control)` only when web-based tools cannot reach the target |
| Subjective/UX judgment | Acknowledge limitation, do best-effort check | Note as LOW confidence |

**Creative verification techniques:**
- **Environment manipulation**: To test "works without X
  installed", run the command in a subshell where X is
  unavailable (e.g., use a venv without the package, or
  temporarily rename the binary)
- **Negative testing**: To verify error messages appear,
  intentionally trigger the error path and capture stderr
- **Cross-referencing**: To verify "all references updated",
  grep for both the old AND new pattern and confirm counts
- **Dry-run execution**: For Makefile targets, use
  `make -n target` to see what WOULD execute without
  side effects, then run the actual target
- **Diff inspection**: For "verify X changed", use
  `git diff origin/BASE -- file` to show the exact change
- **HTTP probing**: For API endpoints, prefer `curl -sf
  -w '%{http_code}'` (fail-on-error and status code
  capture) over manual `curl | grep`; use `jq -e` to make
  field assertions exit non-zero on mismatch
- **Browser verification**: For UI claims, drive a
  headless browser. Default to the Chrome MCP tool
  (`mcp__plugin_superpowers-chrome_chrome__use_browser`)
  for navigation and DOM assertions: it reuses an existing
  Chrome session and is lightweight. Escalate to a
  Playwright spec only when the test needs scripted
  multi-step flows or visual regression
- **Server lifecycle**: When a manual item assumes "the
  server is running", verify the listener with `curl -sf
  http://localhost:PORT/health` or `nc -z localhost PORT`
  BEFORE running the actual check; mark INCONCLUSIVE
  with evidence if the server is not reachable

### 5.4.3 Execute and Capture Evidence

For each item, execute the strategy and record evidence:

1. Run the verification command
2. Capture stdout/stderr as evidence
3. Assess result: PASS, FAIL, or INCONCLUSIVE
4. Assign confidence level

**Confidence levels:**

| Level | Meaning | When to assign |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| HIGH | Fully verified programmatically | Ran the exact check, output confirms |
| MEDIUM | Partially verified | Checked related behavior but not exact scenario |
| LOW | Superficial or best-effort check | Could only verify syntax/existence, not behavior |
| SKIP | Cannot verify programmatically | Requires UI interaction, visual inspection, etc. |

### 5.4.4 Document Manual Test Results

```markdown
### Manual Test Plan Verification (Agent)

> Agent pre-verification of reviewer test plan.
> Human QA should independently confirm each item.

| # | Test Item | Strategy | Result | Confidence |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Update conserve Makefile:153 | git diff shows fix applied | PASS | HIGH |
| 2 | Verify memory-profile without lib | Ran target after uninstall check | PASS | HIGH |
| 3 | Run abstract plugin tests | `uv run pytest tests/ -v` | PASS | HIGH |
| 4 | Verify YAML valid | `python3 -c "yaml.safe_load(...)"` | PASS | HIGH |
| 5 | Spot-check doc-verify refs | `grep -r` found 0 stale refs | PASS | HIGH |
| 6 | Verify mutation testing discovers dirs | Inspected workflow YAML | PASS | MEDIUM |

**Evidence:**
- [E1]: `git diff origin/master -- plugins/conserve/Makefile` shows
  `command -v` removed
- [E2]: `python3 -c "import memory_profiler"` returns exit code 1;
  `make memory-profile` prints "Install memory_profiler: ..."
- [E3]: `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` -> 21 passed
```

### 5.4.5 Browser Verification Tier Selection

When a manual test item involves the browser/UI, choose the
lightest tool that can verify it. Heavier tools cost more
tokens and setup time; reach for them only when the lighter
option cannot answer the question.

| Tier | Tool | Use when | Cost |
|------|------|----------|------|
| 1 | `mcp__plugin_superpowers-chrome_chrome__use_browser` | Navigate, read DOM/text, and click; reusing local Chrome | Lightest: one MCP call per action |
| 2 | Playwright spec (`scry:browser-recording` patterns) | Multi-step user journeys, login, file upload, visual regression | Spawns a browser per spec; ~5-15s/run |
| 3 | `Skill(phantom:computer-control)` | Native desktop UI, OS dialogs, non-web targets | Heavy: full Computer Use API and sandbox |

**Default to Tier 1.** If you find yourself writing a
Playwright spec just to assert one DOM value, that is a
signal to drop back to the MCP tool.

**Tier 2 spec template** (drop into `tests/playwright/`):

```javascript
// pr-NNN-smoke.spec.ts -- generated for /fix-pr verification
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('PR #NNN: <one-line description of the manual item>', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.BASE_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3000');
  // Assertion: the manual test item phrased as expect()
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: /Dashboard/ })).toBeVisible();
});
```

Run with `npx playwright test tests/playwright/pr-NNN-smoke.spec.ts`
and capture the JSON reporter output as evidence. If
Playwright is not installed, fall back to Tier 1 and note
the limitation in the result row.

**Rules:**
- Attempt EVERY item, even if verification is only partial
- Never fake evidence: if you cannot verify, mark SKIP
  with an honest explanation
- Items marked MEDIUM, LOW, or SKIP deserve extra attention
  from human QA
- A FAIL in this section does NOT block proceeding (unlike
  automated tests), but MUST be reported prominently

## 5.5 Run Quality Gates

```bash
# Execute the quality gate commands from the test plan
make test && make lint && make build

# Or project-specific commands
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run ruff check .
```

## 5.6 Document Test Results

Record test execution results for the summary:

    ```markdown
    ### Test Plan Results

    | Issue ID | Verification | Status | Notes |
    |----------|--------------|--------|-------|
    | B1 | All steps passed | PASS | Token validation working |
    | B2 | All steps passed | PASS | Parameterized queries |
    | S1 | All steps passed | PASS | Password reset implemented |

    **Quality Gates:**
    - Tests: 142 passed, 0 failed [PASS]
    - Lint: No issues [PASS]
    - Build: Success [PASS]
    ```

**Test Plan Execution Rules:**
- Execute ALL verification steps for blocking issues
- Execute ALL verification steps for in-scope issues
- Execute manual test plan items with creative strategies (5.4)
- Run quality gate commands AFTER individual issue verification
- Document any failures and fix before proceeding
- All automated tests must pass before moving to Step 6
- Manual test item FAILs must be reported but do not block

**If Test Plan Not Found:**
If no test plan exists from `/pr-review`, generate verification
steps on-the-fly:
1. For each fix applied, identify relevant test file
2. Run targeted tests for the modified code
3. Run overall quality gates
4. Document results

## 5.7 Diff-Derived Validation (validate-pr)

After 5.1-5.6, run `Skill(sanctum:validate-pr)` to generate and
execute a validation plan matched to what actually changed in this
MR. This step replaces the generic "suite passes" claim with
targeted, area-level evidence and a revert-test quality check.

**Invocation (automatic from `/fix-pr`):**

```markdown
Skill(sanctum:validate-pr) with:
  mr: <current MR number>
  post: false          # results feed into Step 6 Gate 3, not posted here
  revert_tests: 1      # one representative revert-test quality check
```

**What it does:**

1. Fetches the diff and groups changed files by area (Rust, Python,
   Shell, grammar, build/config)
2. Generates at least one verification step per area
3. Executes each step and captures evidence (`[E1]`, `[E2]`, ...)
4. Runs one revert-test: breaks a representative fix, confirms the
   test fails, restores via `git checkout -- <file>`
5. Runs the final full-suite test (cargo test --workspace or
   uv run pytest)
6. Produces a summary table: Area | Step | Evidence | Result

**Halt condition:**

If `validate-pr` reports any **FAIL** step, `/fix-pr` halts before
Step 6 (Complete/Gate 3). Fix the failures, then re-run from Step 5.
Pass `--skip-validate` to bypass for scope=minor or
formatting-only fixes.

**Skip conditions:**

- `--scope minor` with only formatting or doc changes (no logic changed)
- `--skip-validate` flag passed explicitly to `/fix-pr`
- No diff available (branch is clean after fixes)

**Summary table feeds Gate 3:**

The validate-pr summary table is included verbatim in the Step 6.5
summary comment, so the full validation evidence appears in Gate 3.

**Step 5 Output**: All tests passing, quality gates green,
manual test plan agent-verified with evidence, diff-derived
validate-pr summary table ready for Gate 3
