# Create Skill Command

Creates new skills through a structured workflow: **iron-law → brainstorm → scaffold → validate**. Uses Socratic questioning to refine rough ideas into well-designed skills before generating any files.

**Important**: This workflow enforces the Iron Law. You cannot create skill files without first creating and running failing tests. See [Iron Law Interlock](../shared-modules/iron-law-interlock.md).

## Usage

```bash
# Start with brainstorming (recommended)
/create-skill "a skill for analyzing test coverage gaps"

# Skip brainstorming if you already have a clear design
/create-skill analyzing-coverage --skip-brainstorm

# Create in specific plugin
/create-skill "debugging async race conditions" --plugin parseltongue
```

## Workflow

### Phase -1: Iron Law Interlock (Blocking)

**This phase is required and cannot be skipped.**

Before any file creation, satisfy the Iron Law interlock. See [iron-law-interlock.md](../shared-modules/iron-law-interlock.md) for full details.

#### Quick Reference

1. **Create test file FIRST**: `tests/test_${skill_name}_skill.py`
2. **Write structural tests**: File exists, frontmatter valid, registered in plugin.json
3. **Run tests - capture RED state**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_${skill_name}_skill.py -v
   # Expected: FAILED (skill does not exist)
   ```
4. **Capture evidence**:
   ```markdown
   [E1] Command: pytest tests/test_${skill_name}_skill.py -v
   Output: FAILED - FileNotFoundError
   Status: RED - Interlock satisfied
   ```
5. **TodoWrite**: `proof:iron-law-red`, `proof:iron-law-interlock-satisfied`

**Only after completing Phase -1 may you proceed.**

---

### Phase 0: Methodology Curation (Optional but Recommended)

Before brainstorming, consider surfacing expert frameworks for your domain.

**Invoke the methodology-curator skill:**
```
Use abstract:methodology-curator to surface proven methodologies before brainstorming.
```

This is especially valuable when:
- Creating skills that teach techniques (debugging, testing, reviewing)
- Building knowledge management features
- Designing decision frameworks
- The domain has recognized experts (most do!)

### Phase 0.5: Brainstorming (Default)

After methodology curation (or if skipping it), refine the skill idea through collaborative dialogue.

**Invoke the brainstorming skill:**
```
Use superpowers:brainstorming to refine this skill idea before scaffolding.
```

The brainstorming phase will:

1. **Understand the idea** - One question at a time:
   - What problem does this skill solve?
   - Who is the target user? (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - What triggers this skill's use? ("Use when..." clause)
   - What should this skill NOT be used for?

2. **Explore approaches** - Present 2-3 alternatives:
   - Single detailed skill vs. modular with hub
   - Technique-focused vs. pattern-focused vs. reference-focused
   - Standalone vs. integrated with existing skills

3. **Validate the design** - Present in sections:
   - Core principles (what makes this skill effective?)
   - Quick start example (the 80% use case)
   - Edge cases and anti-patterns
   - Module breakdown (if modular)

4. **Document the design**:
   - Write to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<skill-name>-design.md`
   - Commit the design document

**Skip brainstorming** with `--skip-brainstorm` only when:
- You have a written design document already
- The skill is a simple extraction from existing content
- You're creating a module for an existing skill

### Phase 1: Gather Requirements

After brainstorming (or with `--skip-brainstorm`), the command prompts for:

1. **Skill name** (if not provided)
   - Must be kebab-case
   - Maximum 64 characters
   - Gerund form preferred (e.g., `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-logs`)
   - No `SKILL` suffix in name

2. **Skill type**:
   - `technique` (default): Concrete methods and procedures
   - `pattern`: Mental models and frameworks
   - `reference`: API documentation and lookup tables

3. **Brief description**:
   - Third-person perspective
   - Must include "Use when" clause
   - 1-2 sentences maximum

4. **Target audience** (optional):
   - Beginner, intermediate, advanced
   - Specific roles (backend dev, data scientist, etc.)

5. **Category tags** (optional):
   - testing, performance, security, architecture, etc.

### Phase 2: Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Standard skill structure
skills/${skill_name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file (hub)
├── modules/              # Optional modules directory
├── scripts/              # Optional automation scripts
└── baseline-scenarios.md # TDD test scenarios
```

For modular skills, creates additional structure:
```bash
skills/${skill_name}/
├── SKILL.md
├── modules/
│   └── README.md         # Module organization guide
├── scripts/
│   └── README.md         # Script usage guide
└── baseline-scenarios.md
```

### Phase 3: Generate SKILL.md Template

Creates SKILL.md with:

```markdown
---
name: ${skill_name}
description: ${description}
category: ${category}
tags: [${tags}]
status: draft
created: ${date}
updated: ${date}
---

# ${Skill Title}

## Overview

${description_expanded}

## When To Use

Use this skill when:
- ${condition_1}
- ${condition_2}
- ${condition_3}

Do NOT use when:
- ${anti_condition_1}
- ${anti_condition_2}

## When NOT To Use

- Simple file edits that don't need structured workflow
- Already have a working solution - just implement it

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

${quick_example}

### Common Scenarios

1. **${scenario_1}**
   ${scenario_1_description}

2. **${scenario_2}**
   ${scenario_2_description}

## Core Principles

${principles}

## Modules

<!-- Add module references as you create them -->

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: ${issue_1}
**Solution**: ${solution_1}

## Related Skills

- See also: ${related_skill_1}
- Complements: ${related_skill_2}

## References

- ${reference_1}
- ${reference_2}
```

### Phase 4: TDD Preparation

Creates `baseline-scenarios.md` for documenting test-first development:

```markdown
# Baseline Testing Scenarios

## Purpose

Document Claude's behavior WITHOUT this skill to identify gaps and validate improvements.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: ${scenario_name}

**Context**: ${setup_context}

**Task**: ${task_description}

**Expected Issues** (without skill):
- ${expected_issue_1}
- ${expected_issue_2}

**Baseline Response**:
```
${verbatim_response_placeholder}
```

**Failure Mode**: ${what_went_wrong}

**Rationalization Detected**: ${excuses_given}

---

### Scenario 2: ${scenario_name}

...

## Testing Protocol

1. **RED Phase**: Run scenarios WITHOUT skill loaded
   - Document exact responses
   - Note all failures and rationalizations
   - Identify patterns

2. **GREEN Phase**: Run scenarios WITH skill loaded
   - Document improvements
   - Note any remaining issues
   - Identify new rationalizations

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Bulletproof the skill
   - Add explicit counters for rationalizations
   - Close loopholes
   - Re-test until perfect

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All scenarios pass with skill loaded
- [ ] No new failure modes introduced
- [ ] Rationalizations eliminated or countered
- [ ] Skill instructions followed consistently
```

### Phase 5: Initial Validation

Runs validation checks automatically:

```bash
# Validate frontmatter structure
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/skill_validator.py \
  skills/${skill_name}/SKILL.md

# Validate skill structure
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/skill_analyzer.py \
  skills/${skill_name}/SKILL.md --validate

# Check for common issues
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/abstract_validator.py \
  skills/${skill_name}/
```

Output:
```
Validation Results:
  OK Frontmatter valid
  OK Directory structure correct
  OK Name follows conventions
  OK Description includes "Use when"
  [WARN] No modules yet (expected for new skill)
  [WARN] Baseline scenarios need completion

Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
```

### Phase 6: Next Steps Guide

Provides actionable guidance:

```
OK Skill scaffolding complete: skills/${skill_name}/

Next Steps (TDD Workflow):

1. RED PHASE - Document Baseline Failures
   - Edit baseline-scenarios.md with 3+ pressure scenarios
   - Run scenarios WITHOUT skill loaded
   - Document exact failures and rationalizations
   - Command: /test-skill skills/${skill_name} --phase red

2. GREEN PHASE - Write Minimal Content
   - Edit SKILL.md with minimal content to address failures
   - Keep it simple and focused
   - Run scenarios WITH skill loaded
   - Document improvements
   - Command: /test-skill skills/${skill_name} --phase green

3. REFACTOR PHASE - Bulletproof the Skill
   - Identify new rationalizations from GREEN testing
   - Add explicit counters and close loopholes
   - Create rationalization table
   - Re-test until bulletproof
   - Command: /bulletproof-skill skills/${skill_name}

4. VALIDATE & DEPLOY
   - Run final validation: /validate-plugin
   - Analyze tokens: /estimate-tokens skills/${skill_name}
   - Update version to 1.0.0
   - Remove 'draft' status
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Technique Skill

```bash
/create-skill analyzing-logs --type technique

Creating skill: analyzing-logs
Type: technique
Directory: skills/analyzing-logs/

Prompts:
  Description: Systematic log analysis techniques for debugging. Use when investigating errors or performance issues.
  Category: debugging
  Tags: logs, debugging, troubleshooting

Created:
  OK skills/analyzing-logs/SKILL.md (412 bytes)
  OK skills/analyzing-logs/modules/ (empty)
  OK skills/analyzing-logs/scripts/ (empty)
  OK skills/analyzing-logs/baseline-scenarios.md (1,247 bytes)

Validation: PASSED (2 warnings)

Next: Document baseline scenarios in baseline-scenarios.md
```

### Example 2: Pattern Skill

```bash
/create-skill mental-models --type pattern

Creating skill: mental-models
Type: pattern

Prompts:
  Description: Core thinking frameworks for software design decisions. Use when evaluating architectural tradeoffs.
  Category: architecture
  Tags: patterns, architecture, decision-making

Created:
  OK skills/mental-models/SKILL.md (534 bytes)
  OK skills/mental-models/modules/
  OK skills/mental-models/modules/README.md
  OK skills/mental-models/baseline-scenarios.md

Pattern skills typically benefit from modularization.
Consider: /analyze-skill skills/mental-models after initial content
```

### Example 3: Reference Skill

## Integration with TDD Workflow

This command is the entry point to the full TDD skill development cycle:

1. **Create** → Use this command for scaffolding
2. **Red** → Use `/test-skill --phase red` for baseline testing
3. **Green** → Edit SKILL.md, then `/test-skill --phase green`
4. **Refactor** → Use `/bulletproof-skill` for anti-rationalization
5. **Validate** → Use `/validate-plugin` for final checks
