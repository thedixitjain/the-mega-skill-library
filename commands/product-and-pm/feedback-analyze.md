## Analysis Framework

I'll organize feedback into categories:

1. **Pain Points: Current frustrations and problems**
2. **Blockers: Critical issues preventing use**
3. **Feature Requests**: **Desired new functionality**
4. **Praise**: What users love
5. **Confusion**: Misunderstandings or unclear features
6. **Bugs**: Technical issues

For each category, I'll provide:
- **Frequency**: How often mentioned
- **Severity**: Impact on user experience
- **Themes**: Underlying patterns
- **Quotes**: Representative user voice
- **Recommendations**: What to do about it

## Output Formats

### Executive Summary
```markdown
# Customer Feedback Analysis - [Date Range]

**Overview**: [One paragraph summary]

**Top 5 Insights**:
1. [Insight with impact and frequency]
2. [Insight with impact and frequency]
...

**Priority Recommendations**:

2. [Action item based on feedback]
...
```

### Detailed Theme Report
```markdown
## Theme: [Theme Name]

**Frequency**: [X mentions, Y% of responses]
**Sentiment**: [Positive/Negative/Mixed]
**Impact**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Description**: [What users are saying]

**Representative Quotes**:

```

### Comparison Matrix
| Theme | Our Product | Competitor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature X | "Users frustrated" (15 mentions) | "Users love it" (8 mentions) |

## Best Practices

1. **Look for Patterns**: One complaint is noise, ten is a signal
2. **Understand Context**: Who is the user? What **are they trying to do**?
3. **Separate Symptoms from Root Causes**: "Too slow" might mean "poor onboarding"
4. **Weight by Segment**: **Feedback from power users vs. churned** users
5. **Track Over Time**: Is this new or longstanding?
6. **Use User Language**: Quote actual words, don't paraphrase
7. **Prioritize by Impact × Frequency**: Focus on high-impact, common issues

Now let's analyze your customer feedback!
