# Attune Specify Command

Transform project briefs into structured, testable specifications with functional requirements and acceptance criteria.

## When To Use

Use this command when you need to:
- Transform brainstorm output into detailed specification
- Create testable requirements from project brief
- Define acceptance criteria for implementation
- Document functional and non-functional requirements
- Establish scope boundaries before planning

## When NOT To Use

Avoid this command if:
- Still exploring problem space (use `/attune:brainstorm` first)
- Already have detailed specification (use `/attune:blueprint` instead)
- Need to refine existing spec (edit specification document directly)
- Making architectural decisions without requirements (brainstorm first)

## Usage

```bash
# Create specification from brainstorm output
/attune:specify

# Specify with custom input
/attune:specify --input docs/project-brief.md

# Generate specification for specific feature
/attune:specify --feature "user authentication"
```

## What This Command Does

1. **Loads project brief** from brainstorm phase
2. **Invokes specification skill** with spec-kit integration
3. **Generates detailed requirements** using structured format
4. **Creates testable acceptance criteria**
5. **Produces specification document** for planning phase

## Integration with Spec-Kit

When spec-kit plugin is available:
- Uses `Skill(spec-kit:spec-writing)` for specification methodology
- Applies structured requirement templates
- Ensures testable acceptance criteria

Without spec-kit:
- Falls back to attune's native specification skill
- Provides similar step-by-step approach
- Documents requirements systematically

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Invoke specification skill
Skill(attune:project-specification)

# 2. Transform brief into structured spec:
#    - Functional requirements
#    - Non-functional requirements
#    - Acceptance criteria
#    - Technical constraints
#    - Dependencies

# 3. Generate specification document
#    - Saved to docs/specification.md
#    - Includes all requirements with testability

# 4. Workflow auto-continues (see below)
```

### Workflow Continuation Protocol (MANDATORY)

**After specification completes successfully**, auto-proceed to the next phase unless `--standalone` was specified:

1. **Verify artifact**: Confirm `docs/specification.md` exists and is non-empty
2. **Checkpoint message**: Display brief summary to user:
   ```
   Specification complete. Saved to docs/specification.md.
   Proceeding to planning phase...
   ```
3. **Auto-invoke next phase**:
   ```
   Skill(attune:project-planning)
   ```

**Bypass Conditions** (skip auto-continuation if ANY true):
- `--standalone` flag was provided
- `docs/specification.md` does not exist or is empty
- User explicitly requests to stop after specification

## Arguments

- `--input <path>` - Input brief file (default: docs/project-brief.md)
- `--output <path>` - Output spec file (default: docs/specification.md)
- `--feature <name>` - Specify single feature instead of full project
- `--clarify` - Run clarification phase (like spec-kit clarify)
- `--standalone` - Run only this phase; do not auto-proceed to planning

# Technical Debt Tracker - Specification

## Overview

**Purpose**: Provide systematic technical debt tracking integrated with GitHub

**Scope**:
- IN: GitHub issue integration, debt prioritization, reporting
- OUT: Multi-platform support, custom integrations, AI recommendations

**Stakeholders**:
- Development teams (primary users)
- Tech leads (debt review and prioritization)
- Engineering managers (reporting and metrics)

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: GitHub Issue Discovery

**Description**: Automatically discover and categorize technical debt from GitHub issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given a repository with issues, when scanning is triggered, then all issues with `tech-debt` label are imported
- [ ] Given imported issues, when categorizing, then each is assigned a debt type (code quality, architecture, security, performance)
- [ ] Given categorized issues, when displaying, then issues are grouped by type and priority

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: M

### FR-002: Debt Prioritization Framework

**Description**: Calculate priority score for each debt item based on impact and effort

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given a debt item, when calculating priority, then score = (impact × urgency) / effort
- [ ] Given priority scores, when displaying, then items are ranked highest to lowest
- [ ] Given a debt item, when impact/effort changes, then priority recalculates automatically

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: FR-001
**Estimated Effort**: M

### FR-003: Interactive Dashboard

**Description**: Web dashboard showing debt overview and trends

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given authenticated user, when accessing dashboard, then see total debt count and trend
- [ ] Given dashboard view, when filtering, then can filter by type, priority, age
- [ ] Given dashboard view, when clicking item, then navigate to GitHub issue

**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: FR-001, FR-002
**Estimated Effort**: L

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance

- Load dashboard in < 2 seconds for repos with < 1000 issues
- Sync with GitHub every 15 minutes
- Support concurrent access by 10+ users

### NFR-002: Security

- OAuth GitHub authentication required
- Read-only access to GitHub repositories
- No data persistence of sensitive information

### NFR-003: Reliability

- 99% uptime during business hours
- Graceful degradation if GitHub API unavailable
- Error logging and monitoring

## Technical Constraints

**Stack**:
- Backend: Python 3.10+ with FastAPI
- Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+
- Deployment: Docker containers on cloud platform

**GitHub Integration**:
- GitHub App with webhook subscriptions
- REST API for issue queries
- OAuth for user authentication

## Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Multi-platform support (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- AI-powered recommendations
- Custom integration plugins
- Mobile application
- Jira synchronization

## Acceptance Testing

Each FR must have:
1. Automated unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. End-to-end test scenario

## Success Criteria

Project is successful when:
- [ ] All High priority FRs implemented and tested
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Successfully deployed to production
- [ ] 5+ teams actively using the tool
- [ ] 90%+ user satisfaction score
```

### Example 2: Single Feature Specification

```bash
/attune:specify --feature "user authentication"
```

Creates feature-specific specification in `docs/specs/feature-user-authentication.md`

### Example 3: Clarification Phase

```bash
/attune:specify --clarify
```

Runs clarification questions (like spec-kit):
```
📋 Specification Clarification

Reviewing docs/specification.md...

Questions to resolve ambiguities:

1. FR-001: What happens if issue has no tech-debt label but mentions "debt" in description?
   → [Need clarification]

2. NFR-001: Does "< 2 seconds" include initial authentication or subsequent loads?
   → [Need clarification]

3. Technical Constraints: Which cloud platform? AWS, GCP, Azure?
   → [Need clarification]
```

/attune:brainstorm    ← Generate project brief
      ↓ [auto]
/attune:specify       ← You are here
      ↓ [auto]
/attune:blueprint     ← Plan architecture

## Quality Checks

The specification skill automatically validates:
- ✅ All requirements have acceptance criteria
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are testable (Given-When-Then format)
- ✅ No ambiguous language ("might", "could", "maybe")
- ✅ Dependencies are documented
- ✅ Effort estimates provided
- ✅ Out of scope explicitly stated

## Related Commands

- `/attune:brainstorm` - Generate project brief
- `/attune:blueprint` - Create implementation plan from spec
- `/speckit-specify` - Spec-kit's specification workflow (if available)
- `/speckit-clarify` - Spec-kit's clarification workflow (if available)

## Related Skills

- `Skill(attune:project-specification)` - Specification methodology
- `Skill(spec-kit:spec-writing)` - Spec-kit spec writing (if available)
- `Skill(imbue:scope-guard)` - Scope creep prevention

## Spec-Kit Integration

When spec-kit is installed, this command automatically:
- Invokes `Skill(spec-kit:spec-writing)` for specification framework
- Uses spec-kit templates and validation
- Enables `/attune:specify --clarify` mode

Check if spec-kit is available:
```bash
/plugin list | grep spec-kit
```

Install spec-kit:
```bash
/plugin install spec-kit@claude-night-market
```
