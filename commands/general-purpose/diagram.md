# /diagram

Turn `/understand` and `/validate` JSON outputs into Mermaid diagrams. Instead of reading raw JSON, you get a visual map of entry points, trust boundaries, sinks, attack trees, and attack paths.

## Usage

```
/diagram <out-dir> [--target <name>] [--stdout] [--force]
```

It renders everything it can find in the directory. Use `--stdout` for a
read-only preview, or `--force` if you really do want to overwrite an existing
`diagrams.md`.

## What gets rendered

| Source file | Diagram type | Shows |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `context-map.json` | flowchart LR | Entry points → trust boundaries → sinks; unchecked flows as dashed edges |
| `attack-surface.json` | flowchart LR | Same layout, Stage B view |
| `flow-trace-*.json` | flowchart TD | Each hop in the call chain, tainted variable at each step, branches, attacker control |
| `attack-tree.json` | flowchart TD | Knowledge graph with nodes styled by status (confirmed/disproven/exploring/unexplored) |
| `attack-paths.json` | flowchart TD per path | Step chain with proximity score (0–10) and blocker annotations |

Black-box binary `context-map.json` files also render xref-backed candidate call
edges as dotted grey edges labelled `candidate`. They are deliberately not
drawn as unchecked flows because a binary xref is not taint proof.

## Examples

```
# Everything from a /understand run
/diagram .out/code-understanding-20240101/

# Include a target name in the header
/diagram .out/exploitability-validation-20240101/ --target myapp

# Print to stdout
/diagram .out/code-understanding-20240101/ --stdout
```

## Output

Writes `diagrams.md` into the target directory next to the existing JSON files. One Mermaid fenced block per diagram, with section headings. Renders in GitHub, VS Code, Obsidian, or anything Mermaid-aware.

## Execution

```bash
libexec/raptor-render-diagrams <out-dir> [--target <name>] [--stdout] [--force]
```

Parse `$ARGS` for `<out-dir>` and `--target`, then run the command. Show the output path.

## When to run

After any of:
- `/understand --map` (produces `context-map.json`)
- `/understand --trace <entry>` (produces `flow-trace-*.json`)
- `/validate` (produces `attack-surface.json`, `attack-tree.json`, `attack-paths.json`)

Point it at the same output directory. It picks up whatever JSON is there: no configuration needed.
