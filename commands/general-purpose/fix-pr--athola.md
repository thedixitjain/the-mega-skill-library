# Enhanced PR/MR Fix

A progressive workflow for addressing PR/MR review feedback, following the attune pattern. Supports both GitHub PRs and GitLab MRs via `leyline:git-platform` detection.
**analyze** → **triage** → **plan** → **fix** → **validate** → **complete**

## When To Use

Use this command when you need to:
- Responding to PR/MR review comments systematically
- Iterating on PR/MR after reviewer feedback

## When NOT To Use

- Simple changes that don't need the full workflow
- Work already completed through another sanctum command

## Quick Reference

```bash
/fix-pr                        # Full workflow
/fix-pr --from triage          # Skip analysis, start at triage
/fix-pr --to plan              # Stop after planning (dry run)
/fix-pr --scope minor          # Auto-skip steps for minor fixes
/fix-pr --stack                # Fix every PR in the stack in one run
/fix-pr --stack --base main    # Override the stack base branch
/fix-pr --no-stack             # Force single-PR mode
```

## Workflow Steps Overview

| Step | Purpose | Skip When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Analyze** | Fetch PR, comments, context | Already familiar with PR |
| **2. Triage** | Classify comments by type/priority | Single simple fix |
| **3. Plan** | Generate fix strategies | Fixes are obvious |
| **4. Fix** | Apply code changes | Just need validation |
| **5. Validate** | Run tests, version checks, agent-verify manual test plan, then `validate-pr` diff-derived plan with revert-test quality check | Already validated |
| **6. Complete** | **Reconcile all unworked items**, **reply to & resolve threads** (required), create issues, post summary | Never - issue tracking & thread resolution enforced |

**Detailed Steps**: See [Workflow Steps](fix-pr-modules/workflow-steps.md)

## Intelligent Step-Skipping

The workflow auto-detects scope and suggests step-skipping:

**Minor scope** (1-2 simple comments):
- Skip: Analyze, Triage, Plan
- Run: Fix → Validate → Complete

**Medium scope** (3-5 comments, clear fixes):
- Skip: Analyze (if familiar)
- Run: Triage → Plan → Fix → Validate → Complete

**Major scope** (6+ comments, complex changes):
- Run all steps

```bash
# Detect scope automatically
/fix-pr --scope auto

# Override with explicit scope
/fix-pr --scope minor
/fix-pr --scope medium
/fix-pr --scope major
```

## Common Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Full workflow for PR
/fix-pr 123

# With PR URL
/fix-pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
```

### Step Control
```bash
# Skip to specific step
/fix-pr --from plan

# Stop at specific step (dry run)
/fix-pr --to plan

# Run specific range
/fix-pr --from triage --to validate
```

### Commit Strategies
```bash
# Single commit for all fixes (default)
/fix-pr --commit-strategy single

# Separate commit per fix
/fix-pr --commit-strategy separate

# Manual commits (for complex cases)
/fix-pr --commit-strategy manual
```

### Scope Control
```bash
# Auto-detect scope
/fix-pr --scope auto

# Force minor workflow (skip to fix)
/fix-pr --scope minor
```

### Stack Mode (Multi-PR Fix)

When the target PR is part of a stack of dependent PRs
rooted at a common base branch, `/fix-pr` can apply the
fix workflow to every PR in the stack in one invocation.
Each PR still passes its own Gate 1 (thread resolution)
and Gate 2 (issue tracking); the root PR additionally
receives a consolidated stack-level summary.

```bash
# Explicit: fix every PR in the stack containing PR 123
/fix-pr 123 --stack

# Override the base branch (default: master)
/fix-pr 123 --stack --base main

# Force single-PR mode even if a stack is detected
/fix-pr 123 --no-stack
```

**Behavior**:

1. Before Step 1 (Analyze), `/fix-pr` loads
   `Skill(sanctum:stack-mode)` to resolve stack
   membership. Detection uses three strategies: branch
   naming (`stack/<feat>/<slice>`), the `## Stack`
   summary comment posted by `stack-push`, and a
   base-chain walk via `gh pr view --json baseRefName`.
2. Without `--stack` but with a detected stack of size
   >= 2, the command prompts before iterating. Default
   is single-PR mode.
3. With `--stack`, Steps 1-6 run once per PR in
   base-to-tip order. Scope detection is per-PR, so
   one stack can mix minor and major scopes across
   its members.
4. Both mandatory exit gates (thread resolution and
   issue tracking) run per-PR, unchanged.
5. After successful iteration, a single stack summary
   comment lands on the root PR listing each PR, its
   fix status, and a link to its per-PR Gate 2
   reconciliation comment.
6. If any PR fails its gates, iteration halts.
   Downstream PRs are left untouched because their
   review context may now be stale.

**Commit strategy interaction**: with
`--commit-strategy single` (the default), each PR gets
one commit. With `--commit-strategy separate`, each
fix within a PR gets its own commit. Neither crosses
PR boundaries: per-PR branch isolation is preserved.

**Stack-mode contract**: see `Skill(sanctum:stack-mode)`
for the shared detection, iteration, and summary
format used by both `/fix-pr --stack` and
`/pr-review --stack`.

## Quick Start

1. **Simple PR fixes** (1-2 comments):
   ```bash
   /fix-pr <pr-number> --scope minor
   ```

2. **Medium complexity** (3-5 comments):
   ```bash
   /fix-pr <pr-number>
   ```

3. **Complex refactoring** (6+ comments):
   ```bash
   /fix-pr <pr-number> --scope major
   ```

4. **Just planning** (dry run):
   ```bash
   /fix-pr <pr-number> --to plan
   ```

## War Room Checkpoint (Automatic)

**Purpose**: Assess whether complex PR feedback warrants expert deliberation before planning fixes.

**Auto-triggers when** (moderate approach):
- Scope is major (6+ comments), OR
- Conflicting reviewer feedback detected, OR
- Multiple refactoring suggestions (>2), OR
- Breaking change required by reviewer

**Checkpoint invocation** (automatic, after Step 2 Triage):

```markdown
Skill(attune:war-room-checkpoint) with context:
  source_command: "fix-pr"
  decision_needed: "Fix strategy for PR #123 review feedback"
  blocking_items: [
    {type: "refactor", description: "Reviewer A: Extract service class"},
    {type: "refactor", description: "Reviewer B: Keep inline, add tests only"},
    {type: "breaking", description: "API signature change required"}
  ]
  files_affected: [files from triage analysis]
  profile: [from user settings, default: "default"]
```

**War Room Questions** (when escalated):
- "How do we reconcile conflicting reviewer suggestions?"
- "Should we push back on any suggestions as out-of-scope?"
- "Is a multi-commit or multi-PR approach appropriate?"

**Response handling**:

| RS Score | Mode | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| RS <= 0.40 | Express | Quick recommendation, continue |
| RS 0.41-0.60 | Lightweight | Panel reviews conflicting feedback |
| RS > 0.60 | Full Council | Full deliberation on approach |

**Auto-continue logic**:
- If confidence > 0.8: Apply War Room's fix strategy
- If confidence <= 0.8: Present options to user

**Skip conditions**:
- Scope is minor or medium with clear fixes
- No conflicting feedback
- Single reviewer, straightforward comments

## Agent Teams (Default for Major Scope)

Agent teams is **on by default** for major scope PRs (6+ comments). Teammates parallelize fix implementation and coordinate via inbox messaging when fixes touch related code. Use `--no-agent-teams` to force sequential/Task tool execution.

**Automatic downgrade**: Agent teams is skipped for minor/medium scope (≤5 comments). Use `--no-agent-teams` to disable for any invocation.

**Requires**: Claude Code 2.1.32+, tmux, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. Falls back to sequential execution if unavailable.

```bash
# Major scope uses agent teams by default
/fix-pr 123 --scope major

# Disable agent teams explicitly
/fix-pr 123 --scope major --no-agent-teams
```

## Integration

This command integrates with:
- **attune workflow**: Follows analyze to triage to plan to fix to validate pattern
- **gh CLI**: Fetches PR data, resolves threads, updates issues
- **git**: Commits changes, pushes updates
- **test suite**: Runs verification after fixes
- **Claude Code Tasks** (2.1.16+): Progress tracking with native Tasks system
- **Agent Teams** (2.1.32+): Optional parallel fix execution for major scope PRs
- **sanctum:stack-mode**: Multi-PR stack iteration contract (used by `--stack`)
- **abstract:post_review_insights**: Posts fix findings to Discussions after validate

### Discussion Insights (after validate)

After the validate step succeeds, write a fix summary to
`reviews/pr-<NNN>-fix.md` (the same format /pr-review uses) and run:

```bash
python3 plugins/abstract/scripts/post_review_insights.py \
  reviews/pr-<NNN>-fix.md --pr <NNN>
```

Each fix becomes a `[PR Finding]` Insight discussion with the
"recently iterated" body. The InsightRegistry deduplicates against
the original /pr-review post by content hash, so the discussion is
updated rather than duplicated when the same finding is touched
twice. Skip with `--no-insights` for trivial fixes.

### Claude Code Tasks Integration

When running in Claude Code 2.1.16+, workflow steps are tracked via native Tasks:

```python
from tasks_manager import TasksManager
manager = TasksManager(
    project_path=Path("."),
    fallback_state_file=Path(".sanctum/fix-pr-state.json"),
)

# Each workflow step becomes a task
for step in ["analyze", "triage", "plan", "fix", "validate", "complete"]:
    task_id = manager.ensure_task_exists(f"PR Fix: {step}")
    # Execute step...
    manager.update_task_status(task_id, "complete")
```

**Benefits**:
- Resume interrupted PR fix workflows across sessions
- Tasks visible in VS Code sidebar
- Dependency tracking (can't validate before fix)
- Cross-session state with `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID="sanctum-fix-pr-{pr_number}"`

## Mandatory Exit Gate

**The workflow is not complete until both gates pass.**

### Gate 1: Thread Resolution

```bash
# Get PR info
REPO_FULL=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
OWNER=$(echo "$REPO_FULL" | cut -d'/' -f1)
REPO=$(echo "$REPO_FULL" | cut -d'/' -f2)
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

# Check for unresolved threads
UNRESOLVED=$(gh api graphql -f query="
query {
  repository(owner: \"$OWNER\", name: \"$REPO\") {
    pullRequest(number: $PR_NUM) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes { isResolved }
      }
    }
  }
}" --jq '[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)] | length')

if [[ "$UNRESOLVED" -gt 0 ]]; then
  echo "❌ GATE 1 FAILED: $UNRESOLVED unresolved threads"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✓ GATE 1 PASSED: All threads resolved"
fi
```

### Gate 2: Issue Tracking Verification (NEW)

**Every review item must be either fixed or have a GitHub issue created.**

Before completing, verify the triage reconciliation:

```markdown
## Issue Tracking Checklist (Required)

For EACH item from triage (Step 2), confirm ONE of:
- [ ] **Fixed**: Code change applied and committed
- [ ] **Issue Created**: GitHub issue number recorded (e.g., #45)
- [ ] **Skipped (justified)**: Informational/praise only - no action needed

| Triage ID | Category | Disposition | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| C1 | Critical | Fixed | commit abc123 |
| S1 | Suggestion | Issue #45 | gh issue view 45 |
| S2 | Suggestion | Fixed | commit abc123 |
| D1 | Deferred | Issue #46 | gh issue view 46 |
| I1 | Informational | Skipped | No action needed |

**Gate 2 fails if any row has empty "Disposition" or "Evidence".**
```

**Automatic verification** (run after populating table):
```bash
# Verify issues were actually created for deferred/suggestion items
# This should match the count from your triage

# Count issues created today referencing this PR
ISSUES_CREATED=$(gh issue list --search "PR #$PR_NUM in:body" --json number --jq 'length')
echo "Issues created referencing PR #$PR_NUM: $ISSUES_CREATED"

# If triage had N suggestion/deferred items, ISSUES_CREATED should be >= N
# (unless they were all fixed directly)
```

### Gate 3: Summary Posted

The PR summary comment (Step 6.5) must include:
- All fixed items with commit references
- All created issues with issue numbers
- Explicit "None" if no suggestions/deferred items

**This gate is required.** If any gate fails:
1. Execute [Step 6: Complete](fix-pr-modules/steps/6-complete.md)
2. Reply to each thread with fix description
3. Resolve each thread via GraphQL
4. Re-run this gate until it passes

**The `--to` flag cannot skip Step 6** - use `--to validate` for dry runs, but completing the workflow always requires thread resolution.

### Record Lessons Learned (decision journal)

If this work involved rework, a failed approach, or a blocker, record it to
`docs/lessons-learned.md` so the insight survives past the session (draft and
confirm):

- If leyline is installed, invoke `Skill(leyline:decision-journal)` and append
  a lesson entry (`what_happened`, `what_didnt_work`, `root_cause`, `action`;
  set `phase` to `review`). Show the draft; append on confirmation.
- Fallback (leyline absent): append to `docs/lessons-learned.md` using the
  in-file ENTRY TEMPLATE; assign the next `LL-NNN` id.
