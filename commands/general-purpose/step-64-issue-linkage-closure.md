## 6.4 Issue Linkage & Closure

**Analyze whether this PR addresses any open issues and close/comment on them accordingly.**

**Fetch Open Issues:**
```bash
# Get all open issues for the repository
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels --limit 50
```

**Analyze Issue Coverage:**

For each open issue, analyze whether the PR's changes address it:

```bash
# Get PR changed files and commit messages
gh pr view --json files,commits -q '{files: .files[].path, commits: .commits[].messageHeadline}'

# Compare against issue requirements:
# - Extract acceptance criteria from issue body
# - Check if changed files relate to issue scope
# - Review commit messages for issue references
```

**Classification:**
| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Fully Addressed** | All acceptance criteria met, all required changes made | Comment and Close |
| **Partially Addressed** | Some criteria met, some work remaining | Comment with follow-up details |
| **Not Related** | PR doesn't touch issue scope | Skip |
