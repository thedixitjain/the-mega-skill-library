# Research Command

Start an autonomous multi-source research session.

## Usage

```bash
# Full research session
/tome:research "async python patterns"

# Choose output format
/tome:research "cache eviction policies" --format brief

# Resume most recent session
/tome:research --resume

# List saved sessions
/tome:research --list

# Override domain classification
/tome:research "raft consensus" --domain architecture
```

## What Happens

1. Topic is classified into a domain (algorithm, ui-ux,
   architecture, etc.)
2. Research channels are selected based on domain
3. Parallel agents search each channel autonomously
4. Findings are merged, deduplicated, and ranked
5. A formatted report is generated and saved
6. You can refine results with `/tome:dig`

## Execution

Invoke the research skill:

```
Skill(tome:research)
```

Pass the topic, format flag, and any overrides.

## Output

Reports are saved to `docs/research/{session}-{topic}.md`.

## See Also

- `/tome:dig`: refine results interactively
- `/tome:cite`: generate bibliography
- `/tome:export`: export to memory-palace format
