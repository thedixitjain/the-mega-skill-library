## Quality Enforcement

All generated content automatically:

1. Avoids tier-1 slop words
2. Follows grounding principle (specifics over adjectives)
3. Uses appropriate sentence variation
4. Skips formulaic openers/closers
5. Runs through slop-detector in **prevention mode** before output

Prevention mode is strict. Any of the following in newly
generated prose is a hard failure that must be fixed before
write:

- Em-dashes (target: zero; replace with comma/colon/period/paren)
- Plus-sign as conjunction in prose ("hooks + skills")
- ASCII / Unicode arrows in prose (`->`, `→`)
- Spatial copula with inanimate subject ("lives in", "sits
  at", "stands as", "rests on", "serves as", "boasts")
- Negative parallelism ("Not X but Y", "It's not X, it's Y",
  "Y, not X", "No X. No Y. Just Z.", "No X, no Y, no Z",
  "And that's okay.")
- Throat-clearing openers ("Here's the thing,", "Look,",
  "Let that sink in.")
- Three-fragment burst ("Focused. Aligned. Measurable.")
- Smart quotes outside code blocks

See `Skill(scribe:slop-detector)` § Step 4.6 for the full
prevention catalog and `modules/remediation-strategies.md`
§ Tier 5 / 2026 for the substitution tables.
