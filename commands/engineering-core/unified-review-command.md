# Unified Review Command

Run a detailed review using intelligent skill selection based on codebase analysis.

## Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect and run appropriate reviews
/full-review

# Focus on specific domains
/full-review api          # API surface review
/full-review architecture # Architecture review
/full-review bugs         # Bug hunting
/full-review tests        # Test suite review
/full-review rust         # Rust-specific review
/full-review math         # Mathematical review
/full-review makefile     # Makefile review
/full-review safety-critical # NASA Power of 10 verifiable-code review
/full-review all          # Run all applicable
```

## Skill Detection

Automatically selects review skills based on:

1. **Language Detection**: File extensions and manifests
2. **File Patterns**: Makefiles, API definitions, test files
3. **Git Context**: Status and diffs
4. **Project Structure**: Architecture patterns and build systems

## Detection Matrix

| Pattern | Skills Triggered |
|---------|-----------------|
| `*.rs`, `Cargo.toml` | rust-review, bug-review, api-review |
| `openapi.yaml`, `routes/` | api-review, architecture-review |
| `test_*.py`, `*_test.go` | test-review, bug-review |
| `Makefile`, `*.mk` | makefile-review |
| Math algorithms | math-review, bug-review |
| ADRs, architecture docs | architecture-review |
| Low assertion density, unbounded loops, unproven recursion, fixed-bound violations | safety-critical-patterns |

## Execution Flow

1. **Context Analysis**: Analyze repository structure
2. **Skill Selection**: Choose based on detected patterns
3. **Parallel Dispatch**: Launch agents using the mapping below
4. **Integrated Report**: Consolidate findings

## Agent Dispatch Mapping

Skills are NOT agents. Use this table to dispatch correctly:

| Skill | Agent Type | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| bug-review | `pensive:code-reviewer` | Bugs, API, tests |
| api-review | `pensive:code-reviewer` | API focus |
| test-review | `pensive:code-reviewer` | Test focus |
| architecture-review | `pensive:architecture-reviewer` | ADR, design |
| rust-review | `pensive:rust-auditor` | Rust-specific |
| code-refinement | `pensive:code-refiner` | Quality |
| math-review | `general-purpose` | Invoke `Skill(pensive:math-review)` |
| makefile-review | `general-purpose` | Invoke `Skill(pensive:makefile-review)` |
| shell-review | `general-purpose` | Invoke `Skill(pensive:shell-review)` |
| safety-critical-patterns | `general-purpose` | Invoke `Skill(pensive:safety-critical-patterns)` |

When `pensive:code-reviewer` covers multiple domains,
dispatch once with combined scope rather than multiple
times with the same agent type.

## Output

- **Summary**: Overall assessment
- **Domain Findings**: Per-skill analysis
- **Integrated Issues**: Cross-domain patterns
- **Action Items**: Prioritized with owners
