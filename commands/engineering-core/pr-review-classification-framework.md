# PR Review: Classification Framework

Review classification system and scope mode details.

> **See Also**: [Main Command](../../pr-review.md) | [Workflow](review-workflow.md) | [Configuration](review-configuration.md)

## Review Classification Framework

### Blocking Issues
Must fix before merge:
- **Version mismatches** (marketplace vs actual, CHANGELOG missing, etc.)
- Bugs introduced by this change
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes without migration
- Missing core requirements
- Test failures in new code
- **Tests that pass with the fix reverted** (they protect nothing)

### In-Scope Issues
Should address in this PR:
- Incomplete requirement implementation
- Missing error handling specified in requirements
- Performance issues affecting feature
- Edge cases not covered
- **Agent-generated code left uncurated** (redundant implementations, incomplete refactors, premature abstractions)
- **Tests that only assert old behavior** without covering the new code path

### Suggestions (Author's Discretion)
Nice improvements:
- Better variable names
- Minor optimizations
- Additional test cases
- Documentation improvements
- **PR atomicity**: splitting a large multi-concern PR into focused pieces (75%+ defect detection for small PRs vs 30% for large)
- **Self-review cleanup**: squashing fixup commits, removing debug statements

### Backlog Items
Create GitHub issues (primary storage):
- Refactoring opportunities
- "While we're here" improvements
- Feature expansions
- Technical debt in adjacent code

**Important**: GitHub issues are the source of truth for backlog items. Reference existing `docs/backlog/*.md` files for context (e.g., `docs/backlog/queue.md`, `docs/backlog/technical-debt.md`) to avoid duplicates.

## Enhanced Example

```bash
/pr-review 42 --scope-mode standard --create-backlog-issues
```

### Sample Output

```markdown
## PR #42: Add user authentication system

### Scope Compliance Analysis
**Source:** docs/plans/2025-12-01-auth-design.md

**Requirements:**
1. [x] JWT token generation - Implemented in auth.py
2. [x] Password hashing with bcrypt - Implemented in utils.py
3. [x] Login endpoint - Implemented in routes/auth.py
4. [x] Token validation middleware - Partially implemented
5. [ ] Password reset flow - **Missing**

### Superpowers Code Analysis
**Files Changed:** 12 files, +542/-89 lines
**Coverage:** New code 85% covered

### Blocking Issues (2)
> Must fix before merge

1. **[B1] Missing token validation**
   - Location: middleware/auth.py:45
   - Issue: Always returns True, validation not implemented
   - Superpowers finding: Critical security gap
   - Fix: Implement JWT signature verification

2. **[B2] SQL injection vulnerability**
   - Location: models/user.py:123
   - Issue: String interpolation in query
   - Superpowers finding: High severity security issue
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries

### In-Scope Issues (3)
> Related to requirements

1. **[S1] Password reset flow missing**
   - Requirement: "Users must be able to reset passwords"
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Fix: Add password reset endpoints and email handling

2. **[S2] Error handling incomplete**
   - Location: auth.py:78
   - Issue: No error handling for invalid tokens
   - Fix: Add try/catch with proper error responses

### Suggestions (4)
> Author's discretion

1. **[G1] Add rate limiting to login endpoint**
   - Superpowers recommendation: Prevent brute force attacks
   - Location: routes/auth.py:23

2. **[G2] Consider using refresh tokens**
   - Superpowers finding: Better security pattern
   - Location: auth.py:45

### Backlog → GitHub Issues Created (5)
> Out of scope for this PR

1. #247 - Add two-factor authentication support
2. #248 - Implement user roles and permissions
3. #249 - Add audit logging for authentication events
4. #250 - Social login integration (OAuth2)
5. #251 - Session management dashboard

### Recommendation
**REQUEST CHANGES**
Address blocking issues B1-B2 and in-scope issue S1 before merge.
Implementation looks promising once core requirements are complete.
```

## PR Hygiene Checks

In addition to scope and code quality, every review
evaluates four hygiene principles. See
`plugins/sanctum/skills/pr-review/modules/pr-hygiene.md`
for detection heuristics and classification tables.

| Principle | Phase | Typical Severity |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Self-review before sending | Phase 1 | SUGGESTION |
| One PR = one logical change | Phase 1 | SUGGESTION / IN-SCOPE |
| Agent code needs curation | Phase 2.5 | IN-SCOPE |
| Tests should test your code | Phase 2.5 | IN-SCOPE / BLOCKING |

### The Revert Test (Test Quality)

The gold standard: if someone reverts the fix, at least
one test should fail. Tests that pass on revert are
documentation, not regression protection. These are
classified as BLOCKING when no other test covers the
changed code path, or IN-SCOPE when coverage exists
but is incomplete.

### Agent Code Curation

AI tools produce code fast, but the output needs review
for: redundant implementations, unnecessary complexity,
incomplete refactors, and scope drift. Formatting commits
and mixed-concern refactors are telltale signs of
iterative AI generation without a cleanup pass. These
are classified as IN-SCOPE.

## Scope Mode Details

### Strict Mode
All requirements must be fully implemented:
- No missing features
- Complete error handling
- Full test coverage
- Documentation complete

### Standard Mode (Default)
Core functionality required:
- Main features working
- Basic error handling
- Critical tests passing
- Essential documentation

### Flexible Mode
MVP acceptable:
- Basic functionality works
- Critical path tested
- Security requirements met
- Future work tracked
