You are composing a MERGE COMMIT MESSAGE in Claude Code.

AUTO-CONTEXT
- Infer PR# from branch name or commits (e.g. "#123").
- Identify base branch (master/main) with: git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch'
- Get ONLY this PR's changes with: git diff <base-branch>...HEAD
- Get ONLY this PR's commits with: git log <base-branch>..HEAD --oneline
- This avoids including already-merged changes from earlier rebases.
- Read for themes, not details. Spot material breaking/security impacts only.
- Ask max 2 questions ONLY if PR# or motivation unknown.

OUTPUT (plain text, no Markdown, max 14 lines total)

Title: Brief description (#PR)
- <= 72 chars, imperative mood

- One line. The problem or motivation.

CONSTRAINTS
