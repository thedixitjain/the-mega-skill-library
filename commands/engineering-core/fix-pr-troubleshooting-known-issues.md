# Fix PR: Troubleshooting & Known Issues

Error handling, troubleshooting guide, and known issues.

> **See Also**: [Main Command](../fix-pr.md) | [Workflow Steps](workflow-steps.md) | [Configuration](configuration-options.md)

## Best Practices

### Before Running
1. validate clean working directory
2. Pull latest changes from remote
3. Confirm PR is still open
4. Check for merge conflicts

### During Execution
1. Review proposed fixes before applying
2. Monitor for unexpected side effects
3. Keep detailed logs of changes made
4. Verify tests still pass after each batch

### After Completion
1. Push changes to remote
2. **VERIFY all threads have replies** - each addressed comment must have a response
3. **Threads auto-resolved via Phase 7** - `/resolve-threads` runs automatically
4. **POST SUMMARY COMMENT (MANDATORY)** - See Phase 6. This step is NOT optional.
5. Check CI pipeline status
6. Notify reviewers of updates
7. If any threads couldn't be resolved, document them in a PR comment

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub API Limits
```bash
Error: GitHub API rate limit exceeded
Solution: Wait and retry, or use --dry-run mode
```

### Complex Review Comments
```bash
Warning: Unable to auto-generate fix for comment
Manual review required: "Consider broader architectural implications"
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
Error: Fix conflicts with recent changes
Solution: Pull latest, resolve conflicts, re-run the command
```

## Thread Resolution Failures

### Review in PENDING State (Cannot Resolve Threads)

**Problem:** Thread resolution fails or threads can't be queried because the review is still in PENDING state.

**Symptoms:**
- GraphQL thread queries may return empty or incomplete data
- Thread resolution mutations fail silently
- Pre-check script detects PENDING reviews and exits

**Root Cause:** When a reviewer starts a review but hasn't submitted it (clicked "Submit review"), the review remains in PENDING state. Threads associated with pending reviews:
- May not be visible via the GraphQL API
- Cannot be resolved until the review is submitted
- Are in a draft/limbo state

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check for pending reviews
gh pr view --json reviews -q '.reviews[] | {author: .author.login, state: .state}'

# If you see state: "PENDING", the review hasn't been submitted
```

**Solution:**
1. **If you are the reviewer:** Submit or discard your pending review in the GitHub UI
2. **If waiting on someone else:** Ask them to submit their review
3. **After review is submitted:** Re-run `/fix-pr` to process the now-resolved threads

**Prevention:**
- The pre-check in Step 6 now detects PENDING reviews and provides clear instructions
- Always verify review state before attempting thread resolution

---

### Threads Not Being Commented On or Resolved

**Problem:** After running `/fix-pr`, review threads are not commented on and remain unresolved.

**Root Cause:** Step 6.3 (Thread Resolution) is documented but not being executed during workflow.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if TodoWrite items were created for thread resolution:
   ```bash
   # Look for these todos in the session:
   # - fix-pr:thread-preflight
   # - fix-pr:thread-reply
   # - fix-pr:thread-resolve
   # - fix-pr:thread-validate
   ```

2. Verify threads actually exist:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes | length'
   ```

**Solution:**
1. **Manual execution** - Run Step 6.3 manually from `workflow-steps.md`
2. **Use standalone command** - Run `/resolve-threads <pr-number>` as fallback
3. **Verify enforcement** - Step 6.3 now includes validation checkpoint that blocks proceeding if threads aren't resolved

**Prevention:**
- Step 6.3 now includes TodoWrite items to track execution
- Validation checkpoint prevents skipping thread resolution
- Pre-flight check confirms threads exist before attempting resolution

### Validation Checkpoint Failing

**Problem:** Step 6.3 validation reports threads still unresolved after attempting to resolve them.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check which threads are still unresolved
gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq -r '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | "\(.path):\(.line)"'
```

**Common Causes:**
1. **GraphQL mutation failed silently** - Check for API errors
2. **Wrong thread ID used** - Verify using `PRRT_*` format, not numeric comment ID
3. **Permissions issue** - Token may lack `repo` scope for thread resolution
4. **Wrong mutation name** - Use `resolveReviewThread` NOT `resolvePullRequestReviewThread` (which doesn't exist)

**Solution:**
1. Re-run thread resolution with verbose output:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(...) }' --include
   ```

2. Check token permissions:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   # Ensure "repo" scope is granted
   ```

3. Use `/resolve-threads` command which handles errors better:
   ```bash
   /resolve-threads <pr-number>
   ```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Bash Command Substitution in gh Commands

**Problem:** Using `$()` substitution inside `gh api` commands causes shell syntax errors.

```bash
# WRONG - This FAILS with syntax errors
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/40/comments  # Breaks due to escaping issues
```

**Solution:** Get repo info separately, then use literal values:

```bash
# CORRECT - get info first, then use literals
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
# Returns: owner/repo

# Then use the actual values directly in the query
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/40/comments
```

### Wrong Mutation for Thread Replies

**Problem:** `addPullRequestReviewComment` mutation doesn't accept `pullRequestReviewThreadId`.

```bash
# WRONG - This FAILS
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewComment(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_xxx"  # Not a valid field!
    body: "Fixed"
  }) { comment { id } }
}'
```

**Solution:** Use `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` instead:

```bash
# CORRECT - This works
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_xxx"
    body: "Fixed"
  }) { comment { id } }
}'
```

### REST API for Review Thread Replies

**Problem:** REST API endpoint for comment replies doesn't work for review threads.

**Solution:** Always use GraphQL `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` for review threads.

### Thread ID vs Comment ID Confusion

**Problem:** Review comments have both comment IDs (numeric) and thread IDs (`PRRT_*`). Resolution requires thread IDs.

**Solution:** When fetching review threads, extract the `id` field which contains the `PRRT_*` thread ID:

```bash
# The 'id' field in reviewThreads.nodes is the PRRT_* thread ID
gh api graphql -f query='...' | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[].id'
# Returns: PRRT_kwDOQcL40c5l9_nO
```

### Empty Review Threads When Threads Exist

**Problem:** GraphQL query returns `reviewThreads.nodes: []` even though review threads are visible in the GitHub UI.

**Common Causes:**
1. **Wrong repository owner/name** - Using assumed repo name instead of verified one
2. **Fork vs upstream confusion** - PR may be on a fork with different owner
3. **Caching/timing** - Threads just created may not appear immediately

**Solution:** Always verify repository info BEFORE running GraphQL queries:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Get correct repo info first
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
# Returns actual owner/repo (e.g., "athola/repo" not "assumed-owner/repo")

# Get PR number
gh pr view --json number -q .number

# THEN use the verified values in GraphQL
```

**Cross-validation:** If threads are empty but reviews exist, re-check:
```bash
# Check if reviews exist
gh pr view --json reviews --jq '.reviews | length'
# If > 0 but threads empty, verify repo owner is correct

# Also check review comments via REST as fallback
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments
```

**Real example of this failure:**
```bash
# Wrong (assumed owner)
gh api graphql ... repository(owner: "alexyoung", ...)  # Returns empty

# Correct (verified owner)
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner  # Returns "athola/..."
gh api graphql ... repository(owner: "athola", ...)  # Returns 7 threads
```

## Migration Notes

- `/fix-pr` now includes the enhanced superpowers-driven workflow (formerly `/fix-pr-wrapper`).
- Use `--dry-run` to preview the planned fixes before applying changes.

## Notes

- Requires GitHub CLI authentication
- Works best with superpowers code review analysis
- Maintains full backward compatibility
- Preserves all original Sanctum GitHub integrations
- Adds intelligent fix generation and contextual understanding
- **Thread resolution is MANDATORY** - every addressed comment MUST receive a reply and be resolved
- If thread resolution fails, document the failure and attempt manual resolution
- **Issue linkage** automatically analyzes open issues and closes/comments on addressed ones
- Use `--skip-issue-linkage` for faster execution when issue analysis is not needed
- **Threads auto-resolved** - `/resolve-threads` runs automatically as Phase 7 for final cleanup
- **Version validation verification** (Phase 3.5) re-checks version consistency after fixes are applied
  - Ensures B-VERSION issues from `/pr-review` were actually fixed
  - Blocks proceeding to test plan execution if version mismatches remain
  - Supports: pyproject.toml, package.json, Cargo.toml, marketplace.json, CHANGELOG.md

## Integration with Attune Workflow

This command follows the attune-style progressive workflow pattern:

```
Attune Workflow        | /fix-pr Equivalent
-----------------------|-------------------
/attune:brainstorm     | (PR review received)
/attune:arch-init      | --
/attune:specify        | Step 1: Analyze
/attune:blueprint           | Step 2-3: Triage + Plan
/attune:init           | --
/attune:execute        | Step 4-5: Fix + Validate
/attune:validate       | (included in Step 5)
/attune:upgrade-project        | (optional: /attune:upgrade-project --component workflows)
```
