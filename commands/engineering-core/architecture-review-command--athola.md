# Architecture Review Command

Principal-level architecture assessment against ADRs and design patterns.

## Usage

```bash
/architecture-review
```

## What It Does

1. **Context**: Establish review scope
2. **ADR Audit**: Check architecture decisions
3. **Interaction Mapping**: Diagram dependencies
4. **Principle Checks**: Validate design patterns
5. **Risk Assessment**: Document consequences

## Scope

- Module boundaries
- Dependency graphs
- Data flow patterns
- Coupling analysis
- ADR compliance

## War Room Checkpoint (Automatic)

**Purpose**: Assess whether architecture findings warrant expert deliberation before recommendation.

**Auto-triggers when** (moderate approach):
- ADR violations without clear remediation path, OR
- High coupling score (>0.7), OR
- Multiple module boundary violations (>2), OR
- Conflicting design principles detected

**Checkpoint invocation** (automatic, after Risk Assessment):

```markdown
Skill(attune:war-room-checkpoint) with context:
  source_command: "architecture-review"
  decision_needed: "Architecture recommendation for [component/PR]"
  blocking_items: [
    {type: "adr", description: "Violates ADR-003 without justification"},
    {type: "coupling", description: "High coupling between auth and payment"}
  ]
  files_affected: [modules under review]
  profile: [from user settings, default: "default"]
```

**War Room Questions** (when escalated):
- "Should we recommend blocking or propose remediation?"
- "Does this coupling warrant refactoring or is it acceptable?"
- "Should a new ADR be created to document this deviation?"

**Response handling**:

| RS Score | Mode | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| RS <= 0.40 | Express | Quick recommendation, continue |
| RS 0.41-0.60 | Lightweight | Panel reviews trade-offs |
| RS > 0.60 | Full Council | Full deliberation on architecture decision |

**Skip conditions**:
- All ADRs compliant
- Coupling within acceptable thresholds
- No boundary violations

## Output

- Architecture assessment
- ADR compliance status
- Coupling violations
- Principle adherence
- Recommendations (Approve/Block)
- War Room session ID (if escalated)
