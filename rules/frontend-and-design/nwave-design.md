# NW-DESIGN: Architecture Design

**Wave**: DESIGN (wave 3 of 6) | **Agents**: Morgan (nw-solution-architect), nw-system-designer, nw-ddd-architect | **Command**: `*design-architecture`

## Overview

Execute DESIGN wave through discovery-driven architecture design. The command routes to the right architect based on design scope: system-level (distributed architecture, scalability), domain-level (DDD, bounded contexts), or application-level (component boundaries, tech stack). Users choose an interaction mode — guided (collaborative Q&A) or propose (architect analyzes requirements and presents options with trade-offs). Analyzes existing codebase, evaluates open-source alternatives, produces C4 diagrams (Mermaid) as mandatory output.

## Interactive Decision Points

### Decision 0: Design Scope (MANDATORY — do NOT skip)

**Question**: What are you designing?

You MUST ask this question before invoking any architect. Do NOT default to application scope. The answer determines WHICH agent to invoke.

**Options**:
1. **System / infrastructure** — distributed architecture, scalability, caching, load balancing, message queues → invokes @nw-system-designer
2. **Domain / bounded contexts** — DDD, aggregates, Event Modeling, event sourcing, context mapping → invokes @nw-ddd-architect
3. **Application / components** — component boundaries, hexagonal architecture, tech stack, ADRs → invokes @nw-solution-architect
4. **Full stack** — all three in sequence: system -> domain -> application → invokes all three agents sequentially

### Decision 1: Interaction Mode

**Question**: How do you want to work?

**Options**:
1. **Guide me** — the architect asks questions, you make decisions together
2. **Propose** — the architect reads your requirements and proposes 2-3 options with trade-offs

## Prior Wave Consultation

Before beginning DESIGN work, read SSOT and prior wave artifacts:

1. **SSOT** (if `docs/product/` exists):
   - `docs/product/architecture/brief.md` — current architecture to extend (if exists)
   - `docs/product/architecture/adr-*.md` — existing architectural decisions
   - `docs/product/journeys/{name}.yaml` — journey schema for port identification
2. **DISCUSS** (primary input): Read from `docs/feature/{feature-id}/discuss/`:
   - `wave-decisions.md` — decision summary
   - `user-stories.md` — functional requirements, system constraints, and scope (includes AC per story)
   - `story-map.md` — walking skeleton, release slicing, and priority rationale
   - `outcome-kpis.md` — quality attributes informing architecture
3. **DISCOVER** (synthesis check only): Read `docs/feature/{feature-id}/discover/wave-decisions.md` — only if architecturally relevant

DISCUSS already synthesizes evidence into structured user stories. DESIGN reads SSOT architecture first (to extend, not recreate), then feature-level artifacts for the delta.

**READING ENFORCEMENT**: You MUST read every file listed in Prior Wave Consultation above using the Read tool before proceeding. After reading, output a confirmation checklist (`✓ {file}` for each read, `⊘ {file} (not found)` for missing). Do NOT skip files that exist — skipping causes architectural decisions disconnected from requirements.

After reading, check whether any DESIGN decisions would contradict DISCUSS requirements. Flag contradictions and resolve with user before proceeding. Example: DISCUSS requires "real-time updates" but DESIGN chooses batch processing — this must be resolved.

## Document Update (Back-Propagation)

When DESIGN decisions change assumptions from prior waves:
1. Document the change in a `## Changed Assumptions` section at the end of the affected DESIGN artifact
2. Reference the original prior-wave document and quote the original assumption
3. State the new assumption and the rationale for the change
4. If architecture constraints require changes to user stories or acceptance criteria, note them in `docs/feature/{feature-id}/design/upstream-changes.md` for the product owner to review

## Discovery Flow

Architecture decisions driven by quality attributes, not pattern shopping:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Review JTBD artifacts from DISCUSS to understand which jobs the architecture must serve. Morgan asks: What are we building? For whom? Which quality attributes matter most? (scalability|maintainability|testability|time-to-market|fault tolerance|auditability)

### Step 2: Understand Constraints
Morgan asks: Team size/experience? Timeline? Existing systems to integrate? Regulatory requirements? Operational maturity (CI/CD, monitoring)?

### Step 3: Team Structure (Conway's Law)
Morgan asks: How many teams? Communication patterns? Does proposed architecture match org chart?

### Step 3.5: Development Paradigm Selection

Morgan identifies primary language(s) from constraints, then applies:

- **FP-native** (Haskell|F#|Scala|Clojure|Elixir): recommend Functional
- **OOP-native** (Java|C#|Go): recommend OOP
- **Multi-paradigm** (TypeScript|Kotlin|Python|Rust|Swift): present both, let user choose based on team experience and domain fit

After confirmation, ask user permission to write paradigm to project CLAUDE.md:
- FP: `This project follows the **functional programming** paradigm. Use @nw-functional-software-crafter for implementation.`
- OOP: `This project follows the **object-oriented** paradigm. Use @nw-software-crafter for implementation.`

Default if user declines/unsure: OOP. User can override later.

### Step 4: Recommend Architecture Based on Drivers
Recommend based on quality attribute priorities|constraints|paradigm from Steps 1-3.5. Default: modular monolith with dependency inversion (ports-and-adapters). Overrides require evidence.

If functional paradigm selected, Morgan adapts architectural strategy:
- Types-first design: define algebraic data types and domain models before components
- Composition pipelines: data flows through transformation chains, not method dispatch
- Pure core / effect shell: domain logic is pure, IO lives at boundaries (adapters are functions)
- Effect boundaries replace port interfaces: function signatures serve as ports
- Immutable state: state changes produce new values, no mutation in the domain
These are strategic guidance items for the architecture document — no code snippets.

### Step 5: Advanced Architecture Stress Analysis (HIDDEN -- `--residuality` flag only)
When activated: apply complexity-science-based stress analysis — stressors|attractors|residues|incidence matrix|resilience modifications. See `stress-analysis` skill.
When not activated: skip entirely, do not mention.

### Step 6: Produce Deliverables
- Architecture document with component boundaries|tech stack|integration patterns
- C4 System Context diagram (Mermaid) -- MANDATORY
- C4 Container diagram (Mermaid) -- MANDATORY
- C4 Component diagrams (Mermaid) -- only for complex subsystems
- ADRs for significant decisions

## Rigor Profile Integration

Before dispatching the architect agent, read rigor config from `.nwave/des-config.json` (key: `rigor`). If absent, use standard defaults.

- **`agent_model`**: Pass as `model` parameter to Task tool. If `"inherit"`, omit `model` (inherits from session).
- **`reviewer_model`**: If design review is performed, use this model for the reviewer agent. If `"skip"`, skip design review.
- **`review_enabled`**: If `false`, skip post-design review step.

## Agent Invocation

### Architect Routing (based on Decision 0)

| Decision 0 | Agent | Focus |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| System / infrastructure | @nw-system-designer | Distributed architecture, scalability, caching, load balancing, message queues |
| Domain / bounded contexts | @nw-ddd-architect | DDD, aggregates, Event Modeling, event sourcing, context mapping |
| Application / components | @nw-solution-architect | Component boundaries, hexagonal architecture, tech stack, ADRs |
| Full stack | @nw-system-designer then @nw-ddd-architect then @nw-solution-architect | All three in sequence |

Pass Decision 1 (guide/propose) to the invoked agent via `interaction_mode` parameter in the Task tool config. If the agent is invoked in a direct session (not via Task), it asks the user for the mode.

All agents write to `docs/product/architecture/` (SSOT). Each architect owns its section:
- @nw-system-designer writes `## System Architecture` in `brief.md`
- @nw-ddd-architect writes `## Domain Model` in `brief.md`
- @nw-solution-architect writes `## Application Architecture` in `brief.md`

**Full stack invocation**: The orchestrator (this task file) makes 3 sequential Task calls:
1. Invoke @nw-system-designer → waits for completion → `brief.md` now has `## System Architecture`
2. Invoke @nw-ddd-architect → reads `## System Architecture` from brief.md → completes → `brief.md` now has `## Domain Model`
3. Invoke @nw-solution-architect → reads both prior sections → completes → `brief.md` has all 3 sections

Each agent reads `docs/product/architecture/brief.md` at start. If prior architects' sections exist, build on them without contradicting. If absent, proceed normally.

### Agent Dispatch (after Decision 0)

Based on Decision 0 answer, invoke the corresponding agent:

**System scope** → @nw-system-designer
**Domain scope** → @nw-ddd-architect
**Application scope** → @nw-solution-architect
**Full stack** → @nw-system-designer then @nw-ddd-architect then @nw-solution-architect (sequential, see Full Stack Invocation above)

Execute \*design-architecture for {feature-id}.

Context files: see Prior Wave Consultation above.

**Configuration:**
- model: rigor.agent_model (omit if "inherit")
- interaction_mode: {Decision 1: "guide" or "propose"}
- interactive: moderate
- output_format: markdown
- diagram_format: mermaid (C4)
- stress_analysis: {true if --residuality flag, false otherwise}

**SKILL_LOADING**: Read your skill files at `~/.claude/skills/nw/solution-architect/`. At Phase 4, always load: `architecture-patterns.md`, `architectural-styles-tradeoffs.md`. Do NOT load `roadmap-design.md` during DESIGN wave -- roadmap creation belongs to the DELIVER wave (`/nw-roadmap` or `/nw-deliver`). Then follow your Skill Loading Strategy table for phase-specific skills.

## Progress Tracking

The invoked agent MUST create a task list from its workflow phases at the start of execution using TaskCreate. Each phase becomes a task with the gate condition as completion criterion. Mark tasks in_progress when starting each phase and completed when the gate passes. This gives the user real-time visibility into progress.

## Wave Decisions Summary

Before completing DESIGN, produce `docs/feature/{feature-id}/design/wave-decisions.md`:

```markdown
# DESIGN Decisions — {feature-id}

## Key Decisions
- [D1] {decision}: {rationale} (see: {source-file})

## Architecture Summary
- Pattern: {e.g., modular monolith with ports-and-adapters}
- Paradigm: {OOP|FP}
- Key components: {list top-level components}

## Technology Stack
- {language/framework}: {rationale}

## Constraints Established
- {architectural constraint}

## Upstream Changes
- {any DISCUSS assumptions changed, with rationale}
```

This summary enables DEVOPS and DISTILL to quickly assess architecture decisions without reading all DESIGN files.

## SSOT Update

After producing feature-level artifacts, update the product-level SSOT:

1. **Architecture SSOT**: Update `docs/product/architecture/brief.md` with new component boundaries, driving ports, and key decisions. Add consumer-labeled sections: `## For Acceptance Designer` (driving ports, test entry points) and `## For Software Crafter` (component boundaries, key decisions). If `brief.md` does not exist, create it.
2. **ADRs**: Write new ADRs to `docs/product/architecture/adr-*.md`. ADRs are permanent — they accumulate, never replaced.
3. **C4 diagrams**: Update `docs/product/architecture/c4-diagrams.md` with current component topology.

If `docs/product/architecture/` does not exist, create it. This is SSOT bootstrap for architecture.

## Expected Outputs

### Feature delta (in `docs/feature/{feature-id}/design/`)
```
  wave-decisions.md              (appends ## DESIGN Decisions section)
```

### SSOT updates (in `docs/product/architecture/`)
```
  brief.md                       (created or updated — includes C4 diagrams, consumer-labeled sections)
  adr-*.md                       (new ADRs for this feature)
  c4-diagrams.md                 (current component topology, if separate from brief)
```

### Optional
```
CLAUDE.md (project root)         (optional: ## Development Paradigm section)
```
